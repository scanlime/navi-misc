# Exploit code which takes control of Cooking Coach via a buffer overflow,
# then patches it and "safely" resumes execution.
#
# XXX: Only works with the US version for now. ("VCKE")
#
#      Also, I'm not sure whether there is more than one version of the
#      US Cooking Coach. If so, this only works on one of them. My ROM's
#      ARM9 binary has a SHA-1 of 4652c0965af21a99ce8248e0c4584a23dd30d1eb
#
# XXX: Only works the first time you load the save, since the game
#      will overwrite the save file. Need to stub out the game's
#      EEPROM write code to fix this.
