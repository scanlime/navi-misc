This directory contains general Python utilities that Googlers have found
useful.

We're starting off with a single module, goopy.functional, that
provides functions useful for functional-style programming (e.g.,
sort, reverse, some, every, remove_duplicates, etc).

To install the module, do:

 python setup.py install

This module requires Python 2.1+ (since it uses nested scopes).

There's documentation in the "doc" directory as well as in the
documentation comments in the source itself.

There's a small unittest in goopy/functional_unittest.py.
