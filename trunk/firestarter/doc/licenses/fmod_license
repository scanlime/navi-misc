***FMOD Licensing Terms***

***Free***
    * Yes that's right, if your product is not intended to make any money, and is not charged for in any way, then you may use FMOD in it for FREE!
    * Many people use it for free until their commercial product is about to be published. This is a great way to evaluate FMOD and see if it suits your needs without any obligations.
    * If you want to use it in a commercial product, then please see below for pricing and conditions. 



***Shareware, hobbyist agreement***	
      Because some developers are single hobbyist programmers, or sell at an extreme low price-points with no distribution except through a website, and no expectations of high sales that could warrant or recoup the price of a normal product/site license, the 'shareware/budget' license option has been created. 

	1 product, PC* only. 	$100

      * PC is classified as WinCE, Win32, Linux or Macintosh
       

      As in the full commercial license pricing information above, the multi-platform discount applies, but all platforms are based on the $100 price point across the board.  For a site license (unlimited shareware/budget products), the 2.5 multiplier still applies.

 Conditions / Limitations
    * 'Shareware' FMOD licenses must be approved on a case by case basis to verify that they qualify for budget or shareware status.    The licensee must be an individual/hobbyist and not a registered business or company with more than 1 employee or director.  A shareware license is available for 1 shareware / budget title only.  No source code is provided with this license.

***MP3 Licensing issues***
	
      If you intend to use mp3 in your product, you will have to contact Thompson Multimedia and arrange to pay for an mp3 license, which is separate to FMOD.

      See www.mp3licensing.com for more information on fees.

      For game developers, you can get a 'game license' to use mp3.  This is only $2500.  See http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/games.html

      Note that with games distributing less than 5000 copies, no mp3 license is required and you can use it for free.


***License features***
	
    * All options include FREE full personal support by the actual author of the product. Many people are amazed at the personal level of attention they get, either by phone, email or even personal visit (if applicable).. MANY new features have been included in a very short turnaround just because someone asked for it.
    * FMOD is actively developed with exciting new features on the drawing board all the time.
    * NO ROYALTIES are required.

    * FMOD is already being used, tried and tested in commercial game environments.  It has been getting rave reviews from users and programmers alike! The ease of use of an extremely flexible API with unbelievable performance makes it the only choice for your in game audio!
    * FMOD is downloaded about 15,000 times a month by developers.  These developers then distribute their products to end users.  You cant get much better testing than that!
    * Have the advantage of actually being able to download the FULL version freely for your own inspection and evaluation, without being locked into any contracts. See the contact section to email Firelight Technologies to arrange for further information.
    * Note that FMOD does not include a free license to distribute MP3 in your product.  See the section above "MP3 Licensing issues" for more information.
