BUILDING
================

Windows
----------------
The only build system right now is for windows, and it is Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1. We do not have project for VC5 or 6..

To build the project you will need several 3rd party librarys to build.

1) SDL. you will need the SDL Development librarys from www.libSDL.org. You will need to install this so that Visual C++ can find the headers and the libs. This can be done by copying the files into the Visual C++ dirs or adding the dirs to the IDE via the prefrences.

2) Ogre. This is the base 3d engine for the system. It is avalabe at www.ogre3d.org. The project asumes that ogre is located one dir level higher then the base appication folder.

3) Ogre Dependencys. These are also avalabe via the ogre site, install them as directed.

Build SDL and Ogre. Then you can build the game.

Before you can run the first time you need to copy the ogre DLLs you have built into the bin and bin/plugins folders. There are text files in each dir that will tell you what DLLs you need. The best place to pull them from is ogrenew/samples/common/bin/

Once you have built you may run. Note Release builds don't run for shit now.
