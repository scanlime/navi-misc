This project holds software and firmware used with
the first generation LED case mod board for Yoshi.
This board received data over a serial link for
controlling 72 LEDs with 4-bit brightness control.

Hopefully someday soon I'll get around to finishing
up the new design that uses an 8x8 matrix (for up
to 256 LEDs) and has an FPGA.
