Blinkenlights release,
July 2, 2002
---------------------

This release contains fully working (as far as I know) firmware for the
clock and LED board projects, as well as simple test programs for both.

This is _not_ the final PC software. I plan on writing a daemon to allow
multiple programs to control hardware connected to the same serial bus, and
an API for easy access to the LEDs and LCDs. This hasn't happened yet, so
there are just a few simple test programs and a very preliminary XMMS plugin.

Have fun with what's here.
