What works:
  sheet-viewer

In progress:
  IRC client

To do:
  Handle different dice systems (D&D and WW for the moment) in dieRoller.py
  Store user preferences in the chat client
  More flexible character sheet layouts
  Character sheet builder
	IRC Bot(?)

If anyone happens to dl this and try to run any of it, the existing layouts
and sheets will not likely open on your machine because the layout file
specified in the data sheets contains the path for the layout on my machine.
In the future this will be a standardized thing that gets set up by the
installer, for now you can just edit the layout attribute of the
character tag in the data files and everything should be kosher, most of the
rest of the paths are relative so they should work fine.
