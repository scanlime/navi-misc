*** Massive reorganization! ***

* Some commands like /close don't seem to work
* Separate buffers for private chat windows
* Tweak dice rolling systems to handle critical failures
* Store user preferences for the chat client
* Character sheet builder
* Change colors in the chat buffer
* Remove extraneous functions in the factory and have the UI access the client via
  the factory instead of adding unnecessary function calls.
* Make chat buffer scroll a little further for niceness of viewing.
* Replace pyxml stuff with twisted's xml stuff.
* Tab completion of nicks.
