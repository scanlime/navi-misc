Before release:
  * Refactoring
  * Store user preferences for the chat client
    * It seems like there should be some kind of check to make sure
      that the attributes the Prefs object gets are only the intended
      ones. (right now if you add 'arf = woof' to .palantirrc it will
      give the Prefs object an arf attribute which will continually
      be rewritten to the file even though it's never used for anything)
    * Try to have the preferences saved in some semblence of an order
      so that they're not getting shifted around all every time the
      prefs are rewritten to the file.
    * Add some kind of apache-config like grouping to some of the
      prefs like colors and extra words to highlight on.
