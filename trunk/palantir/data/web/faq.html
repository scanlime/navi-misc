					<div style="padding-left: 2em">
						'Palantir' is the name of the orb in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R 
						Tolkien that Saruman used to communicate with Sauron. So, since those are my 
						favorite books, and Palantir is meant to be for communication and a reference 
						to this great series of fantasy novels seemed appropriate for a role playing tool 
						I decided to name it Palantir.

						Why can't I connect to multiple IRC servers/channels?

				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<img src="faq-a.png"/>
					<div style="padding-left: 2em">
						Palantir is meant to be a tool for role playing, not chatting on IRC, so it 
						seemed that it was only necessary to implement support for one server and one 
						channel at a time. It's not likely you will ever need to be in multiple channels 
						for one role playing session, and if you have multiple sessions going on 
						simlutaneously it does not seem likely that there will be so many that it would 
						be a hardship to have multiple clients open for each one. Palantir does support 
						separate chat buffers for private messages and if that is not adequate then 
						the problem can likely be solved using existing chat software like Gaim or x-chat 
						in addition to Palantir.

						How do I design my own character sheet layouts?

				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<img src="faq-a.png"/>
					<div style="padding-left: 2em">
						For now you have to create your own XML file for the layout. There probably 
						should be a tutorial for that, but there isn't. The examples included with 
						the package should be enough to provide you with an idea of how to create 
						these. In the not too far off future I hope to have a nice GUI for building 
						these layouts.
