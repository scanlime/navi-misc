						<p>Palantir is a small IRC client designed for playing RPGs (role playing games) 
						over IRC. It was inspired by the OpenRPG project and hopes to take the ideas 
						behind that project to the next level. Palantir has a couple of RPG specific 
						features such as built-in character sheets and dice rolling. Palantir can connect 
						to any IRC server and use any of its RPG features because these have all been 
						implemented utilising the existing IRC protocols. The hope is that this will 
						make it easier and more convenient for people to use.</p>

            <p>Started doin' some work again. Got a decent start on the 
            preferences, there shouldn't be too much work involved. This 
            is still probably pretty sketchy on windows and it's still 
            got a lot of dependencies... At least we're makin' some more 
            progress. Testing is sorely needed, particularly on Windows.</p>
