\section{Problem and Motivation}
There are many areas of science and mathematics where a density field is plotted in order
to visualize a system.  Such plots are especially common in the study of nonlinear dynamics
where iterative systems can exhibit many different kinds of behavior.  Traditionally, these
systems have been visualized using very simple imaging techniques which allow only a few
thousand points to be shown.

In many cases, a few black points on a white background is sufficient as a visualization
of such systems.  However, because dynamical systems can exhibit such strange structure,
it can be deceiving since only a small part of a trajectory can be shown in a single image.
When a statement about a dynamical system is made, that statement refers to the long-term
behavior of the system in a particular state, rather than only a short piece of it. In such
cases, an imaging technique capable of displaying millions of points is required.
