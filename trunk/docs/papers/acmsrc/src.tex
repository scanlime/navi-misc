\section{Problem and Motivation}
There are many areas of science and mathematics where a density field is plotted in order
to visualize a system.  Such plots are especially common in the study of nonlinear dynamics
where iterative systems can exhibit many different kinds of behavior.  Traditionally, these
systems have been visualized using very simple imaging techniques which allow only a few
thousand points to be shown.

In many cases, a few black points on a white background is sufficient as a visualization
of such systems.  However, because dynamical systems can exhibit such strange structure,
it can be deceiving since only a small part of a trajectory can be shown in a single image.
When a statement about a dynamical system is made, that statement refers to the long-term
behavior of the system in a particular state, rather than only a short piece of it.  In such
cases, an imaging technique capable of displaying millions of points is required.

\section{Background}
When plotting points of zero size, each pixel is effectively a bucket which collects samples.
Traditionally, a single sample completely saturates a pixel, which means that the bucket
can be represented by a single bit.  The problem with this approach is that when a pixel is
hit more than once, information is lost.  Instead, if we treat the image region as a variable
depth histogram we can capture all the information contained in a long computation run.

With a histogram, the total image density is tracked as points are added.  The result of this
is that the number of points which can be plotted is unbounded.  To create a visible image
from this histogram structure, we treat it as a high dynamic range image.  

\section{Related Work}
Tone mapping of high dynamic range images has been studied extensively, primarily in the
context of digital photography.  A comprehensive survey of tone-mapping techniques can be
found in \cite{kd}.  Some particularly influential tone-mapping operators are discussed
in \cite{jt}, \cite{jtjhbg} and \cite{gw}.

Histogram-based imaging techniques have been used previously in the rendering of so-called
``fractal flames.''  These are discussed in Scott Draves' informal paper describing the
internals of the \emph{Electric Sheep} screen-saver software\cite{sd}.
