we probably can't have too much text, so we'll need to sum up
the histogram technique in a couple sentances and expand in maybe
2-3 paragraphs. The guidelines say that the main points should be
visible from 3m away, while interested viewers should be able to
read finer points from about 1m away. I estimate the 3m font will
need to be at least 2" high, while the 1m font more like 0.75".
This is maybe even too conservative.

We can probably reduce the amount we say on the poster to the bare
minimum, and interested folks can talk to us in person. We should
probably bring a stack of printed-out abstracts to keep on the table
during the session.

As for images, we ought to have:
* side-by-side comparison of logistic map bifurcation diagram
  rendered with histogram & plotting half-dark points

* something pointing out the 4d-color luminance niftiness
