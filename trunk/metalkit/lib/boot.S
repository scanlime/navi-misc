/*
 * boot.S --
 *
 *    This is a tiny but relatively featureful bootloader for
 *    32-bit standalone apps and kernels. It compiles into one
 *    binary that can be used either stand-alone (loaded directly
 *    by the BIOS, from a floppy disk image) or as a GNU Multiboot
 *    image, loaded by GRUB.
 *
 *    This bootloader loads itself and the attached main program
 *    at 1MB, with the available portions of the first megabyte of
 *    RAM set up as stack space by default.
 *
 *    This loader is capable of loading an entire 1.44MB floppy
 *    image into high memory. It uses the BIOS's floppy driver,
 *    switching back and forth between real mode and protected
 *    mode in order to copy the resulting blocks into high memory.
 *
 *
 * This file is part of Metalkit, a simple collection of modules for
 * writing software that runs on the bare metal. Get the latest code
