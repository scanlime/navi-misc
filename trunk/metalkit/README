"Metalkit" is what I'm calling this set of software
modules for assembling simple programs that operate
on the bare metal: they run on IA32 PCs without any
operating system.

This software is released under the MIT license, so
you're free to copy, modify, and distribute it for
commercial or noncommercial purposes.


What is this good for?
----------------------

- Learning about PC architecture or systems programming.

- For hardware (or virtual machine) developers, writing
  test cases or example programs that demonstrate hardware
  features.

- Simple applications (even games) that can target common
  virtual machines or emulators (QEMU, VMware, Bochs) as
  their platform.

- Fun!


What can it do so far?
----------------------

- It has a nifty bootloader which can bootstrap a 32-bit
  protected mode program from either a raw floppy disk
  image (convenient for Virtual Machines) or from GRUB
  (convenient for real PCs).

- It has simple PCI bus support. So far it's enough to
  enumerate the attached devices.

- VGA text mode.

- Tested on VMware, Bochs, and a real PC.


How can I use it?
-----------------

It's easy. On any x86 system with a 32-bit GNU toolchain installed,
just type 'make' and you should end up with a "boot.img" file. You can
either:

 - Reboot your PC, and use grub to boot this file as a 'kernel'.

 - Point your virtual machine or emulator of choice to boot.img as a
   floppy disk image.

You should be greeted by white text on a blue background, and a listing
of the PCI devices on your machine.


What features are planned?
--------------------------

- Simple IRQ routing.

- A simple single-tasking event driven runloop.

- Video, mouse, and keyboard drivers. (For generic
  PC hardware, and for VMware's mouse and video
  devices.)
