Wasabi is a set-top-box project that focuses on using
pretty graphics and custom hardware to provide a user
interface for playing back media over a LAN and for
selecting video game systems.

Wasabi is written in Python using PyBZEngine, and is
compatible with the MI6K and uvswitch hardware projects.
