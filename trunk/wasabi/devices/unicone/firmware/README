The main Unicone device uses an FPGA, and a TUSB3410 microcontroller
whose firmware needs to be downloaded each time it's reset. The
firmware for this device is in "universal", and will be compiled
to "firmware.bin"

Other devices supported by the Unicone software have firmware stored
in the other directories here. This firmware isn't needed at runtime,
and is included only for people constructing these devices.
