Hardware:
 - mi6k IR transmitter still not working
 - mi6k receiver doesn't work in lircd properly until mode2 is run
 - uvswitch gets interference between input channels, possibly
   an issue with a DC bias and the clamping diodes

UI:
 - After exiting VideoChannelPage, an extra IR button event
   kills the logo immediately
 - Icons being added or removed dynamically animate incorrectly
 - Video detected on an unbound input channel crashes the UI
 - Video inputs becoming inactive during VideoChannelPage crashes the UI
