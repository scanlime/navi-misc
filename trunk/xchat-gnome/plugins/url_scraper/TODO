* When xchat-gnome and the python plugin support it add an object for
	a prefs page that can be sent to xchat-gnome and displayed in the
	preferences window.

* There is a bug in the python plugin preventing you from reloading
	a script that uses extension modules. Add a workaround here until
	the plugin is fixed(?).

* Find a better way of displaying emails in the window when email
	scraping is turned on. Maybe something as simple as being able
	to sort the URL/email column by whether something is an email
	or URL, so that they'll be grouped together.
