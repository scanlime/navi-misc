* When xchat-gnome and the python plugin support it add an object for
	a prefs page that can be sent to xchat-gnome and displayed in the
	preferences window.

* There is a bug in the python plugin preventing you from reloading
	a script that uses extension modules. Add a workaround here until
	the plugin is fixed(?).

* Find a better way of displaying emails in the window when email
	scraping is turned on. Maybe something as simple as being able
	to sort the URL/email column by whether something is an email
	or URL, so that they'll be grouped together.

* Add an option to change the window title whenever there's a new
	URL, the title reverts to normal whenever the window gets focused
	next. Like in Gaim.

* Hook it up to a URL handler so that you can open a link by clicking
	it.

* This is probably too complicated for a little script like this, but
	consider the possibility of allowing users to block certain channels/
	users. So that the scraper doesn't fill up with URLs from commits
	in #commits, for example.

* Add a TreeModelSort.

* Don't keep redundant copies of urls/emails.
