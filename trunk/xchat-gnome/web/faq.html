<h2>frequently anticipated questions</h2>
<br>
<h3>General Questions</h3>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Who are you people?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>Overworked, underpaid, disaffected but generally corporeal college students.</p>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>What is xchat-gnome?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>xchat-gnome is a frontend for the popular
<a href="http://www.xchat.org">X-Chat IRC client</a> targeted towards the GNOME platform.  Our eventual goals include <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> 
interoperability and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG
</a> compliance.</p>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Why is xchat-gnome?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>X-Chat has been a popular and successful open source IRC client
for some time now.  It is undebatably a stable, powerful and fully featured
client, as proven by the number of faithful users it maintains. Unfortunately
X-Chat's UI became cluttered over time as more features were gradually added.
We view xchat-gnome as an opportunity to clean up the X-Chat user interface
while (eventually ;)) keeping the stability and power that X-Chat users have
come to expect.
</p>

<h3>Migrating from X-Chat gtk+</h3>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Can xchat-gnome be configured to use tabs?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>No. Adding this capability would require creating some very messy
code, and doesn't really add anything to the program. xchat-gnome is not meant
to replace X-Chat gtk+ for power users who are attached to its interface, but
instead provide an alternative.</p>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Why no tabs?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>The tree view started as an experiment. It turned out that it is
significantly easier to scan visually than a long list of tabs. It also seems
to have the side effect of removing any guilt that happens from being in a
bazillion channels.</p>
<b>Q</b>.<p>How is the server list edited?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>The server list is edited from the preferences window rather than
the connect dialog.</p>
