<h3>General Questions</h3>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Who are you people?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>College students with far too much time on our hands.</p>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>What is xchat-gnome?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>xchat-gnome is a frontend for the popular
<a href="http://www.xchat.org">X-Chat IRC client</a> targeted towards the GNOME platform.  Our eventual goals include <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> 
interoperability and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG
</a> compliance.</p>
<br>
<b>Q</b>.<p>Why is xchat-gnome?</p>
<b>A</b>.<p>X-Chat has been a popular and successful open source IRC client
for some time now.  It is undebatably a stable, powerful and fully featured
client, as proven by the number of faithful users it maintains. Unfortunately
X-Chat's UI became cluttered over time as more features were gradually added.
We view xchat-gnome as an opportunity to clean up the X-Chat user interface
while (eventually ;)) keeping the stability and power that X-Chat users have
come to expect.
