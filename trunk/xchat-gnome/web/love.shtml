        <p>Feel like giving xchat-gnome some love? There are plenty of tasks that are
	outside of our core focus at the moment but still ought to be done. A lot of
	these are pretty simple, and we'd love to have the help :)</p>

	  <b>New user status icons</b><br />
	  <p>The current bullets next to nicknames in the user list which indicate
	  operator/voice/etc status are inaccessible to colorblind people. In order to
	  fix this, we need new icons that have distinct silhouettes.</p>
