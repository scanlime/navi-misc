        <p>Feel like giving xchat-gnome some love? There are plenty of tasks that are
	outside of our core focus at the moment but still ought to be done. If you're
	giving any of these a try, we're available to answer questions in #xchat-gnome
	on irc.freenode.net. A lot of these are pretty simple, and we'd love to have
	the help :)</p>

	  <b>New user status icons</b><br />
	  <p>The current bullets next to nicknames in the user list which indicate
	  operator/voice/etc status are inaccessible to colorblind people. In order to
	  fix this, we need new icons that have distinct silhouettes.</p>

	<div class="section">
	  <b>Anything, really</b><br />
	  <p>At the moment, we have no user documentation other than the FAQ on this
	  web site. It would be great to have some documentation that can be shown
	  both in yelp and on the web.</p>

	  <b>Fix navigation-pane behavior</b><br />
	  <p>The navigation pane behaves strangely in some cases, such as parting/rejoining
	  channels. A lot involved in fixing this is just to determine what the default
	  behaviors ought to be. If you're unsure about your intuitions, come ask us
	  in #xchat-gnome.</p><br /><br />
	  <b>irc:// URI support</b><br />
	  <p>There are a couple parts to this. The first is a parser for the URI that
	  handles everything in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-butcher-irc-url-02.tx.txt">this internet draft</a>.
	  The second is registering URL handlers with gnome.</p>
