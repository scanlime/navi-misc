        <p>Feel like giving xchat-gnome some love? There are plenty of tasks that are
	outside of our core focus at the moment but still ought to be done. A lot of
	these are pretty simple, and we'd love to have the help :)</p>

	  <b>New user status icons</b><br />
	  <p>The current bullets next to nicknames in the user list which indicate
	  operator/voice/etc status are inaccessible to colorblind people. In order to
	  fix this, we need new icons that have distinct silhouettes.</p>

	  <b>Anything, really</b><br />
	  <p>At the moment, we have no user documentation other than the FAQ on this
	  web site. It would be great to have some documentation that can be shown
	  both in yelp and on the web.</p>
