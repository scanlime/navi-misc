        <p>Feel like giving xchat-gnome some love? There are plenty of tasks that are
	outside of our core focus at the moment but still ought to be done. If you're
	giving any of these a try, we're available to answer questions in #xchat-gnome
	on irc.freenode.net. A lot of these are pretty simple, and we'd love to have
	the help :)</p>

	<div class="section-title">Art Love</div>
        <div class="section">
	  <b>New user status icons</b><br />
	  <p>The current bullets next to nicknames in the user list which indicate
	  operator/voice/etc status are inaccessible to colorblind people. In order to
	  fix this, we need new icons that have distinct silhouettes. This art would
	  be useful to the main XChat line as well, since it suffers from the same problem.</p>
        </div>
	<div class="section-title">Documentation Love</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <b>Anything, really</b><br />
	  <p>At the moment, we have no user documentation other than the FAQ on this
	  web site. It would be great to have some documentation that can be shown
	  both in yelp and on the web.</p>

	<div class="section">
	  <b>Basic A11y</b><br />
	  <p>At the moment, the only accessibility is what gtk+ gives us for free. It
	  would be nice if the most important widgets in the xchat-gnome interface
	  were given a11y metadata in the glade file. This can be pretty easily done
	  in chunks - updating just a few widgets would be better than what we have now.</p><br />

	<div class="section-title">Mid-Level Hackery Love</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <b>New "connect" dialog</b><br />
	  <p>The current connect dialog is pretty boring.  Ideally, it would present a list
	  of networks along with a description (and maybe logo) of the currently selected
	  network.  Gnomechat had this the last time I tried it, and it might still.  This
	  may require some changes to the xchat core.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section-title">Difficult Hackery Love</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <b>GtkXText a11y support</b><br />
	  <p>The XText widget does not include any accessibility support at all. Adding
	  support for the a11y interfaces is probably not a trivial thing, and is probably
	  only a job for someone intimately familiar with how a11y works and willing to
	  deal with a big mess of code in XText.</p>
