        <p>Feel like giving xchat-gnome some love? There are plenty of tasks that are
	outside of our core focus at the moment but still ought to be done. If you're
	giving any of these a try, we're available to answer questions in #xchat-gnome
	on irc.freenode.net. A lot of these are pretty simple, and we'd love to have
	the help :)</p>

	<div class="section-title">Art Love</div>
        <div class="section">
	  <b>New user status icons</b><br />
	  <p>The current bullets next to nicknames in the user list which indicate
	  operator/voice/etc status are inaccessible to colorblind people. In order to
	  fix this, we need new icons that have distinct silhouettes. This art would
	  be useful to the main XChat line as well, since it suffers from the same problem.</p>
        </div>
	<div class="section-title">Documentation &amp; Translation Love</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <b>Help document</b><br />
	  <p>xchat-gnome now has a basic help manual, but it is by no means complete.
	  In addition to this, more documentation on the web site would be helpful.</p><br />
	  <b>Web pages</b><br />
	  <p>xchat-gnome's web page is nice, but doesn't have a whole lot of information.</p><br />
	  <b>Translation</b><br />
	  <p>As of 0.8svn, xchat-gnome can finally be localized.  So far we have part of
	  a French translation.  Having full language coverage would be amazing, so if you're
	  capable of providing a translation, please do!</p>
          <p>xchat-gnome is using
	  <a href="https://launchpad.net/products/xchat-gnome/+translations">rosetta</a> for
	  translations.  Please use it to submit translation work.</p>

	<div class="section-title">Easy Hackery Love</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <b>Basic A11y</b><br />
	  <p>At the moment, the only accessibility is what gtk+ gives us for free. It
	  would be nice if the most important widgets in the xchat-gnome interface
	  were given a11y metadata in the glade file. This can be pretty easily done
	  in chunks - updating just a few widgets would be better than what we have now.</p><br />
	  <b>Non-english spell-checking</b><br />
	  <p>SexySpellEntry includes the ability to use non-english dictionaries, but
	  xchat-gnome doesn't take advantage of this.  Probably the first step is to just
	  include the user's locale.
	  See <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321042">Bug #321042</a>.</p>

	<div class="section">
	  <b>New "connect" dialog</b><br />
	  <p>The current connect dialog is pretty boring.  Ideally, it would present a list
	  of networks along with a description (and maybe logo) of the currently selected
	  network.  Gnomechat had this the last time I tried it, and it might still.  This
	  may require some changes to the xchat core.</p><br />
	  <b>Channel list filtering</b><br />
	  <p>See <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321326">Bug #321326</a>.</p><br />
	  <b>Get FG/BG colors from gnome theme</b>

	<div class="section">
	  <b>GtkXText a11y support</b><br />
	  <p>The XText widget does not include any accessibility support at all. Adding
	  support for the a11y interfaces is probably not a trivial thing, and is probably
	  only a job for someone intimately familiar with how a11y works and willing to
	  deal with a big mess of code in XText.</p>
