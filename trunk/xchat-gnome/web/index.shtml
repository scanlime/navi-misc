          xchat-gnome is a new frontend to the popular X-Chat IRC client which
	  is designed with the user interface foremost in mind. Historically,
	  the OSS desktop has been steadily improving in usability, accessibility,
	  and general slickness, yet the world of IRC clients has not kept up. With
	  IRC being one of the fundamental methods of communication within the open
	  source community, it is bizzare that this area has been neglected.
        </p>
        <p>
          GNOME's philosophy in terms of user interfaces has been progressing
	  towards presenting the user with few options, yet sane defaults. While
	  many of the normal X-Chat options will be preserved inside GConf, only
	  the most common settings will be included in the main user interface.
	  The GTK+ frontend provides excessive customizability, with options scattered
	  throughout the interface. This leads to an inconsistent user experience,
	  confusion, and general clutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing to note is that this project is still extremely young. As such,
	  at the moment is is not extremely trivial to build, run or debug. If anyone
	  is interested in helping out, drop me a line at the email address below or
