<p>
xchat-gnome is a new frontend to the popular X-Chat IRC client which is designed
with the user interface foremost in mind. Historically, the OSS desktop has been
steadily improving in usability, accessibility, and general slickness, yet the
world of IRC clients has not kept up. With IRC being one of the fundamental methods
of communication within the open source community, it is bizzare that this area
has been neglected.
</p>

<p>
The major problem with the GTK+ version of X-Chat is that it provides excessive
customizability, with preferences and options scattered through the user interface.
This leads to an inconsistent user experience, confusion, and general clutter.
One obvious example of this is the ability to turn off the menu bar from the
main chat context menu.
