xchat-gnome is a new frontend to the popular X-Chat IRC client which is designed
with the user interface foremost in mind. Historically, the OSS desktop has been
steadily improving in usability, accessibility, and general slickness, yet the
world of IRC clients has not kept up. With IRC being one of the fundamental methods
of communication within the open source community, it is bizzare that this area
has been neglected.
