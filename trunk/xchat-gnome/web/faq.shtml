        <div class="section">
          <b>Q.</b> Who are you people?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Overworked, underpaid, disaffected but generally corporeal students.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> What is xchat-gnome?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> xchat-gnome is a new frontend for the popular <a href="http://www.xchat.org">X-Chat IRC client</a>
	  targeted towards the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> platform. Our eventual goals include full
	  desktop integration and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG</a> compliance.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Why is xchat-gnome?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> X-Chat has been a popular and successful open-source IRC client for some time now. It is
	  undebateably a stable, powerful and fully featured client, as proven by the number of faithful users
	  it maintains. Unfortunately, X-Chat's user interface became cluttered over time as more features were
	  gradually added. We view xchat-gnome as an opportunity to clean up the X-Chat user interface while
	  (eventually ;)) keeping the stability and power that X-Chat users have come to expect.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Is xchat-gnome a fork?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Not really. xchat-gnome does maintain separate copies of common and plugin sources, but
	  these are synchronized with xchat's code pretty often.  Patches are contributed back to xchat
	  when it makes sense to do so.  There's no technical reason why xchat-gnome couldn't become part
	  of the standard xchat distribution, though it's too early to tell if this will ever actually
	  happen.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b>What happens if xchat goes closed source?<br />
	  <b>A.</b>Recently, zed has stirred up plenty of emotion by licensing the windows build as shareware.
	  Since this itself is questionable regarding the licensing, it's very unlikely that the linux version
	  will ever be closed as well. However, since people seem to worry about such things, here's the answer:
	  xchat-gnome will always stay GPL.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Can you provide packages for my distro?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Probably not. There are some people who contribute packages for their particular distributions,
	  and we're happy to host/provide links to these packages, but it's really not worth our time to learn the
	  ins and outs of packaging for every distribution, especially when there are so many expert packagers out
	  there.<br />

	<div class="section">
	  <b>Q.</b> Ayo Jerks, you got the treeview for windows yet?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> There are no plans to make xchat-gnome run under windows at this point. If eventually the
	  GNOME libraries are ported, support for windows will probably follow.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> You are our slaves! Implement my silly feature requests! Have some drugs!<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No, and that wasn't a question.<br />

        <div class="section-title">Migrating from X-Chat gtk+</div>
        <div class="section">
          <b>Q.</b> Can xchat-gnome be configured to use tabs?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No. Adding this capability would require creating some very messy code, and doesn't really
	  add anything to the program. xchat-gnome is not meant to replace X-Chat gtk+ for power users who have
	  grown attached to its interface, but instead provide an alternative.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Why no tabs?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> The tree view started as an experiment. It turned out that it is significantly easier to scan
	  visually than a long list of horizontal tabs. It also seems to have the side-effect of removing any guilt
	  that stems from being in a bazillion channels.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> You should add tabs<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No, we shouldn't. And that wasn't a question either.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> How is the server list edited?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> The server list is edited from the preferences window rather than the connect dialog<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Can I run xchat and xchat-gnome at the same time?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Well, despite it being a very silly thing to do, it should be possible.  Note that there may
	  be some weird interactions, since configuration is shared by default (and xchat-gnome forces some
	  configuration options).  If you run into problems, we'll try to fix them, but be aware that this isn't
	  a priority for us.<br />
