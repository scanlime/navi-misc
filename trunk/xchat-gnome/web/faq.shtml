          <b>Q.</b> Who are you people?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Overworked, underpaid, disaffected but generally corporeal students.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> What is xchat-gnome?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> xchat-gnome is a new frontend for the popular <a href="http://www.xchat.org">X-Chat IRC client</a>
	  targetted towards the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> platform. Our eventual goals include full
	  desktop integration and <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG</a> compliance.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Why is xchat-gnome?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> X-Chat has been a popular and successful open-source IRC client for some time now. It is
	  undebateably a stable, powerful and fully featured client, as proven by the number of faithful users
	  it maintains. Unfortunately, X-Chat's user interface became cluttered over time as more features were
	  gradually added. We view xchat-gnome as an opportunity to clean up the X-Chat user interface while
	  (eventually ;)) keeping the stability and power that X-Chat users have come to expect.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Is xchat-gnome a fork?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> Not really. xchat-gnome is just a new frontend that drops in to a normal xchat source tree.
	  We don't have a separate xchat codebase, and patches are contributed back to xchat where necessary.
	  There's no technical reason why xchat-gnome couldn't become part of the standard xchat distribution,
	  though it's too early to tell if this will ever actually happen.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b>What happens if xchat goes closed source?<br />
	  <b>A.</b>Recently, zed has stirred up plenty of emotion by licensing the windows build as shareware.
	  Since this itself is questionable regarding the licensing, it's very unlikely that the linux version
	  will ever be closed as well. However, since people seem to worry about such things, here's the answer:
	  xchat-gnome will always stay GPL.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Ayo Jerks, you got the treeview for windows yet?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> There are no plans to make xchat-gnome run under windows at this point. If eventually the
	  GNOME libraries are ported, support for windows will probably follow.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> You are our slaves! Implement my silly feature requests! Have some drugs!<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No, and that wasn't a question.<br />

        <div class="section-title">Migrating from X-Chat gtk+</div>
        <div class="section">
          <b>Q.</b> Can xchat-gnome be configured to use tabs?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No. Adding this capability would require creating some very messy code, and doesn't really
	  add anything to the program. xchat-gnome is not meant to replace X-Chat gtk+ for power users who have
	  grown attached to its interface, but instead provide an alternative.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> Why no tabs?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> The tree view started as an experiment. It turned out that it is significantly easier to scan
	  visually than a long list of horizontal tabs. It also seems to have the side-effect of removing any guilt
	  that stems from being in a bazillion channels.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> You should add tabs<br />
	  <b>A.</b> No, we shouldn't. And that wasn't a question either.<br />
	  <br />
	  <b>Q.</b> How is the server list edited?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> The server list is edited from the preferences window rather than the connect dialog<br />

        <div class="section">
          <b>Q.</b> I compiled it and all I got was this lousy 'xchat' binary. Where's xchat-gnome?<br />
	  <b>A.</b> If you're using 0.1 (which you really shouldn't be at this point), make sure you configured
	  with --enable-gnomefe. You'll find the binary in src/fe-gnome. If you're using 0.2 or the latest SVN,
	  make sure everything was detected properly in the configure stage.<br />
