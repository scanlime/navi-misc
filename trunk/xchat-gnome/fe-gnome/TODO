before release:
* fix paths so that you can install into a prefix / start with any cwd

  autotools:
    * remove gtkspell checks for now
    * check for an adequate version of gtk, gnome, gnome-icon-theme, etc
    * make the autotools stuff install the gnome frontend

-----

* double clicking on an item in the server config list should open its edit box
* fix the about dialog such that it uses a real copyright symbol (check galeon's source
  for this)
* make the connect dialog check existing open networks before creating a new connection

* separate the concepts of leaving & closing. disconnected servers, parted channels, and
  old dialogs should still have their buffers available. This should probably manifest
  itself as greying disconnected things out in the navtree

* find a writer to rewrite all the horribly-worded explainations of things!

* migrate all menus (main, context, etc) to use GtkUIManager

context menus:
* flesh out the userlist context menu
* make the context menu for navtree stuff actually dependent on context - see above note
  about leave/close stuff
