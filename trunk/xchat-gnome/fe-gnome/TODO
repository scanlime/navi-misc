autotools:
  * check for an adequate version of gnome-icon-theme, etc
  * autogenerate inline pngs during build

* lastlog
* make strings translateable --> _("blah")
* if a word-check function is installed into xtext, should make URLs blue
* add/remove in the server list
* the way it looks up the icon in the transfers window is *really* expensive,
  and this happens every time a row is updated. Should probably move the icon
  theme initialization to be "global" and only look up the icon on a new add
* split the transfers window into separate send & recieve windows
* split other dialogs out of xchat-gnome.glade (difficult at this point)
* make functions static where possible
* hook up pgup/pgdn
* topic bar should be a label with a (sometimes insensitive) "change" button
  if using gtk+ 2.5+, allow ellipsizing with an expander, if not just wrap
* double clicking on an item in the server config list should open its edit box

* sort the server/channel list in non-case sensitive alphabetical order

* fix the about dialog such that it uses a real copyright symbol (check galeon's source
  for this)
* make the connect dialog check existing open networks before creating a new connection

* find a writer to rewrite all the horribly-worded explainations of things!

* migrate all menus (main, context, etc) to use GtkUIManager

* make text surrounded by asterisks bold in the xtext widget

context menus:
* flesh out the userlist context menu
* make the context menu for navtree stuff actually dependent on context - see above note
  about leave/close stuff
