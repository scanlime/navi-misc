* Fix schema install
* Hook up apply button in network configuration
* Change server username preferences to be HIG-style:
	o use global user settings
	o use these user settings:
		nick ...
		real ...
* Several options in the 'Discussion' menu don't make sense for servers
* Do we really need a collapse/expand menu item? If yes, we should use
  the accelerator on the menu (is there an accelerator?)
* Connect dialog should have a "connect in new ???" option. Maybe just do
  that as the default and let users close other connections, since replacing
  the current server is weird.
* Double-clicking a server in the networks page should open it's edit dialog
