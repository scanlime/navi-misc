before release:
  autotools:
    * check for an adequate version of gnome-icon-theme, etc

-----

* topic bar should have a tooltip with the entire topic
* double clicking on an item in the server config list should open its edit box
* need to be able to add new servers

* sort the server/channel list in non-case alphabetical order

* fix the about dialog such that it uses a real copyright symbol (check galeon's source
  for this)
* make the connect dialog check existing open networks before creating a new connection

* separate the concepts of leaving & closing. disconnected servers, parted channels, and
  old dialogs should still have their buffers available. This should probably manifest
  itself as greying disconnected things out in the navtree

* find a writer to rewrite all the horribly-worded explainations of things!

* migrate all menus (main, context, etc) to use GtkUIManager

context menus:
* flesh out the userlist context menu
* make the context menu for navtree stuff actually dependent on context - see above note
  about leave/close stuff
