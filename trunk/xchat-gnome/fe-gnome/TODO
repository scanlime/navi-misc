* hook up the autoconnect column in the server prefs
* put automatically connected-to servers at the top of the list
* fix the about dialog such that it uses a real copyright symbol (check galeon's source
  for this)
* make the connect dialog check existing open networks before creating a new connection

* separate the concepts of leaving & closing. disconnected servers, parted channels, and
  old dialogs should still have their buffers available. This should probably manifest
  itself as greying disconnected things out in the navtree

* find a writer to rewrite all the horribly-worded explainations of things!

context menus:
* list accelerators in the context menus
* flesh out the userlist context menu
* switch context menus to use the gnome-popup-menu stuff
* make the context menu for navtree stuff actually dependent on context - see above note
  about leave/close stuff

autotools:
* slurp the gtkspell check from gaim's configure.in
* check for an adequate version of gnome-icon-theme
* make the autotools stuff install the gnome frontend
