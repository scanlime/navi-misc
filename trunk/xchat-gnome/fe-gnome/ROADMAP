This is just a preliminary roadmap, subject to whatever people want to work on.

0.3:
-	Color palette/schemes				- David (complete)
-	Network/server configuration			- David
-	URLScraper plugin				- Evan

	enclosed in intltool _() macros

0.4:
-	Redo DCC UI
-	Autogenerate inline pngs during build
-	Fix connect dialog to check for existing open
	networks before creating a new connection
-	Fix context menus - implement unworking,
	make menus actually depend on the context
-	Fix navigation tree to use non-case-sensitive
	sorting rather than lexicographical order


0.5:
-	Refactor for multiple conversation windows

0.6:
-	User documentation!

undetermined:
-	Integration with autopackage as much as possible (relaytool, etc)
-	Split each dialog out of xchat-gnome.glade into its own file
-	Make URLs in xtext show up as blue (or configurable link color)
-	Make text surrounded by asterisks show up as bold, text surrouned by
	underscores show up as underlined, etc

when releasing:
	check to make sure changelog is complete
	make sure all version numbers are up-to-date
	tag the release
	notify http://www.gnomefiles.org (Dan)
	notify freshmeat (David)
	notify footnotes
