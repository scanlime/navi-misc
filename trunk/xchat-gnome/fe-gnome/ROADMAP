This is just a preliminary roadmap, subject to whatever people want to work on.

0.5:	Features
-	Redo DCC UI						- David
-	Implement options in channel list dialog		- David
-	Allow plugins to add a prefs page to the prefs dialog	- Evan

Future:
-	Finish implementing keybindings UI?			- Dan
-	Fix context menus - implement unworking,
	make menus actually depend on the context
-	Convert individual dialogs/pages into GObjects where
	possible, keeping pointers to widgets - remove most
	of the calls to glade_xml_get_widget(), free GladeXML
	data asap to reduce footprint
-	User documentation!
-	Any other infrastructure for translation
-	Autopackage/binreloc/relaytool
-	Make URLs in xtext show up as blue (gconf configurable color?)
-	Make text surrounded by asterisks show up as bold, text
	surrounded by underscores show up as underlined, etc
-	Refactor for multiple conversation windows?

when releasing:
-	Check to make sure changelog is complete
-	Make sure all version numbers are up-to-date
		(configure.in, ChangeLog)
-	Make sure screenshots on the web site are current
-	Tag the release
-	Notify http://www.gnomefiles.org 			- Dan
-	Notify freshmeat 					- David
-	Notify footnotes
