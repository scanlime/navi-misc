* if a topic contains something that pango thinks might be markup but is invalid,
  it'll just not set it while spitting out a silly warning. An example:
  ["'()`!,&:=@] banned on bb.

* gconf schemas aren't being installed properly

* completion does not properly replace the common base (capitalization-wise)
  when there are multiple matches

* high-speed DCC transfers tend to make the whole application crap out. Other
  DCCs die, lag becomes astronomical. This is almost certainly a real xchat
  bug
