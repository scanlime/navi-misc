* when a tree in the navigation view is closed, it should not act as a selection
  (view should stay on the channel they were in) - this seems to already be the case,
  except its inconsistent (perhaps the first time the tree is closed? haven't tested
  sufficiently)
* networks/channels are not selected properly when starting up (autoconnect)
* when first selecting a channel from the tree, it switches buffers a couple times,
  resulting in a quick flicker
* the completion list is not modified when the user changes nicks
* right now the tree view does not allow focus, due to the momentary highlighting
  being terribly annoying. This should change so that the tree view can be keyboard
  navigable
* if 'refresh' is clicked twice in the channel list, it will send two LIST requests
  and add all the results to the tree. Should probably set the refresh button inactive
  until at least some results come in.
* doesn't save paned positions properly
* status icons
