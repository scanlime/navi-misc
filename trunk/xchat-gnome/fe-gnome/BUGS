* when a tree in the navigation view is closed, it should not act as a selection
  (view should stay on the channel they were in) - this seems to already be the case,
  except its inconsistent (perhaps the first time the tree is closed? haven't tested
  sufficiently)
* tab completion doesn't work - it instead switches focus between widgets
* when first selecting a channel from the tree, it switches buffers a couple times,
  resulting in a quick flicker
* dialog windows don't set their title correctly
