* when a tree in the navigation view is closed, it should not act as a selection
  (view should stay on the channel they were in) - this seems to already be the case,
  except its inconsistent (perhaps the first time the tree is closed? haven't tested
  sufficiently)
* when first selecting a channel from the tree, it switches buffers a couple times,
  resulting in a quick flicker
* dialog "windows" don't set their title correctly
* the completion list is not modified when the user changes nicks
* right now the tree view does not allow focus, due to the momentary highlighting
  being terribly annoying. This should change so that the tree view can be keyboard
  navigable
