* networks/channels are not selected properly when starting up (autoconnect)
* the completion list is not modified when the user changes nicks
* the completion list occasionally gets really messed up on autojoin (maybe joining
  a new channel too) - probably rejoin as well
* maybe it just makes sense to rebuild the completion list whenever there are userlist
  changes
* if 'refresh' is clicked twice in the channel list, it will send two LIST requests
  and add all the results to the tree. Should probably set the refresh button inactive
  until at least some results come in.
* doesn't save paned positions properly
