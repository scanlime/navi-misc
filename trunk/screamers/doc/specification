This file contains my thoughts on what the game should do. Consider it as a
sort of pseudo-requirements doc, but without any hard rules or traceability.

The pod is pretty simple - it floats like a butterfly and moves like a boat (see
the old screamers), has two guns, a set amount of ammunition (which can be refilled
with pick-ups) and a shield (which slowly recharges itself and can be enhanced
with pick-ups, maybe).

Game modes:

FFA:
	Very simple, run around, shoot things. Maybe do smash-bros. style games
	where you can choose between stock or timed?  Either way, I think rounds
	are the way to go, since scoring is meaningful (as opposed to bzflag's
	continuous play). New joining players get in on the next round.

CTF:
	bzflag-style probably works here, at least until i think of something cooler

race:
	canyon pod racing, baby. just because last exile r0x0rz my s0x0rz


As far as pod physics, I'd love for zipping around on a flat surface to feel just
like the old screamers.  For more complicated worlds, I'm thinking that the pod
will have a sort of force field pushing up whose strength is some factor of the
distance to the ground.  This will allow moving around on terrain, but you can still
run into it if you move to fast towards too steep a surface.  There should probably
be some kind of jumping involved, but I haven't thought about that yet
