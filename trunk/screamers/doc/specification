This file contains my thoughts on what the game should do. Consider it as a
sort of pseudo-requirements doc, but without any hard rules or traceability.

The pod is pretty simple - it floats like a butterfly and moves like a boat (see
the old screamers), has two guns, a set amount of ammunition (which can be refilled
with pick-ups) and a shield (which slowly recharges itself and can be enhanced
with pick-ups, maybe).

Game modes:

FFA:
	Very simple, run around, shoot things. Maybe do smash-bros. style games
	where you can choose between stock or timed?  Either way, I think rounds
	are the way to go, since scoring is meaningful (as opposed to bzflag's
	continuous play). New joining players get in on the next round.

CTF:
	bzflag-style probably works here, at least until i think of something cooler

race:
	canyon pod racing, baby. just because last exile r0x0rz my s0x0rz
