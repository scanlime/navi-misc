  <overview>
    When your opponent makes a circle (such as with a haymaker), it is
    very effective to move within that circle and create a smaller circle
    of your own.

      From a right haymaker, step forward with the right foot with the arms
      extended. By keeping the arms out and making contact with them, timing
      is easier. Grab hold of their arm, then step around left forming a
      180. Anchor arms either to chest or waist and throw. By forming the
      smaller circle, you utilize their energy for the throw.

      From a right haymaker, step forward with the right foot with the arms
      extended. Fold the arms and drive the right elbow into their chest.
      Use fishtail-type motion to create inner circles?
      <note>
        Make sure to move in far enough - too far out causes overrotation,
        which saps away power.
