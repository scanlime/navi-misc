This is MICE, which is an acronym for Metro Internet Chat Event.

Technically its not free software, since it I do it at work, so I shall seek to make it as disgusting and unreadable as possible so nobody in their right mind would want to use it.  That said, more than anything else, its just a fun little project for me.

So what is it?  The short answer is a question database with network glue around it.  It has various interfaces for messing with the database, and yeah... so I guess thats enough for a readme :)
