# Below follow layer sizes, the last one is the same as OUTPUTS
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIZE 8 # of layer 0
SIZE 8 # of layer 1
SIZE 3 # of layer 2
# Now follows information on the neural connections
# Basically, MAX_LAYER_SIZE puts an upper bound on the number of neurons in a layer
# so connections are specified as (label 1),(label 2),(weight) where 
# there is a connection from (label 1) --> (label 2) of weight (weight)
# The label of neurons is MAX_LAYER_SIZE*L+N where L is the layer number and N is the
# neuron number in that layer
# Label of input layer is 0, layer below it is 1 and so on
