This directory contains software related to my tinkering with
electric field sensors. Unless otherwise noted, all files here
are released under the LGPL license.

The hardware for my current prototype is a PIC16F877 microcontroller,
the same receive and transmit hardware used in the LazyFish, and
6 electrodes all mounted in a small plastic enclosure.

The 'firmware' directory contains SDCC source code for the device's
microcontroller. The 'python' and 'cpp' directories contain two
different implementations of desktop-side software, including a
low level communications abstraction and higher level signal processing.

Whereas the LazyFish and associated research was based on inverse
electrostatics, the closely spaced and relatively irregular electrodes
used in the prototype led me to persue a neural network based approach.
