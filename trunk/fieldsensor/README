The fieldsensor project encompasses development of hardware and software
for a simple and inexpensive motion tracking input device, operating by
sensing very small changes in capacitance between an array of metal plates.

The hardware design for this project is based on the Lazyfish, presented
by Josh Smith in his PhD thesis on Electric Field Imaging.
