Python CAPTCHA package
======================

About
-----

This is the PyCAPTCHA package, a collection of Python modules
implementing CAPTCHAs: automated tests that humans should pass,
but current computer programs can't. These tests are often
used for security.

See  http://www.captcha.net for more information and examples.

This project was started because the CIA project, written in
Python, needed a CAPTCHA to automate its user creation process
safely. All existing implementations the author could find were
written in Java or for the .NET framework, so a simple Python
alternative was needed.
