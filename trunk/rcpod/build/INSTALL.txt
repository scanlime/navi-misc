==============================
Installing PyRCPOD for Windows
==============================

1. Installing Python, GTK, and PyGTK

Download and run the following installers, in this order:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3/Python-2.3.exe
http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.4.14-rc3.exe
http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports/binaries/pygtk-2.4.1-2.win32-py2.3.exe

3. Install the PyRCPOD package

Download and run the included pyrcpod installer.

2. Installing the RCPOD driver

The first time you plug in the RCPOD, you will need to locate its driver. The
PyRCPOD installer places it in C:\Program Files\PyRCPOD\driver by default.

3. Test it

Run the "Identify Devices" program with an rcpod plugged in. It should find it,
and blink its green LED. Try the "PWM Controller" program. You should be able to
adjust the bottom two sliders to control the brightness of the LEDs. Try the
"ADC Graph" program. It should show a scrolling graph that responds to the analog
inputs on the rcpod board.
