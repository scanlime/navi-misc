Errata for the revision A rcpod-485 PCB and schematic
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The row of resistors including R1, R11, R12, R4, R3, and R7
   is spaced too closely, so not all resistors can lay flat
   against the PCB.

2. The silkscreen for the five LEDs indicates a right-angle
   mount, however upon assembly it was decided that a
   non-right-angle mount would be more useful.

3. The failsafe biasing resistors on the RS-485 line are
   reversed, so when no RS-485 connection is present,
   the (active-low) receive line is low and the RX light
   is on.
   (Is this really worth correcting? Might be a nice feature
    that the RX light is on continuously if the RS-485 network
    is disconnected)
