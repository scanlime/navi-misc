Known bugs in rcpod firmware/software
(Doesn't include hardware bugs, those are listed as ERRATA for each revision)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Serial receive seems to become inoperative at odd times. Try running
  the rs485commtest, then unplugging the RS-485 link during a test.
  Run it again, and one or both rcpods will fail to receive any data.

- There is currently no way to list all data received over RS-485, just ways
  to capture data in a given interval. This could be fixed by making the
  receiver use a ring buffer, providing functions to query the current buffer
  pointers and increment the tail pointer by a given amount.
