Known bugs in rcpod firmware/software
(Doesn't include hardware bugs, those are listed as ERRATA for each revision)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The maximum speed in an rcpod_i2c_dev is ignored. There are provisions in
  the API and protocol for setting the bus speed, but they aren't fully
  implemented yet.

- Even with some of the crazy optimizations in the pin descriptor code, it's
  still too slow to do full speed I2C. Some more aggressive optimizations may
  be helpful later on.
