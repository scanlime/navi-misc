""" rcpod.i2c

This package makes it easy to communicate with I2C peripherals
using Python and the RCPOD. The objects here provide abstractions for
individual I2C busses and devices, based on the low-level I2C code
in librcpod.

The other modules in this package provide interfaces to various I2C
devices. This includes generic devices like I2C EEPROMs, and specialized
devices sorted by manufacturer.
