rcpod - the Remote Controlled PIC of Doom
-----------------------------------------

This is a piece of firmware and a python module that lets you peek and poke values
into the registers of a PIC16C745 or PIC16C765 microcontroller over USB. It is
intended as a way to rapidly prototype firmware or test hardware when timing isn't
critical. Python functions are provided that can control I/O ports and other onboard
hardware like the PWM modules and USART.
