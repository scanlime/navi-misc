rcpod - the Remote Controlled PIC of Doom
-----------------------------------------

This project is centered around firmware for the PIC16C745/765 microcontrollers
that allows the devices to perform I/O operations on behalf of the USB host.
There are PCB designs for projects based on the rcpod firmware, and a C library
using libusb that allows relatively high-level manipulation of I/O ports.


-------- Contents of this package:

 hardware : PCB designs and schematics for boards based on rcpod.
            Currently this includes a test harness board with RS-485,
	    and a multi-port I2C bus interface with remote thermal sensors.

 firmware : Assembly language source for the rcpod firmware. The firmware
            accepts simple commands via USB control requests.

 include : Header files for librcpod and the firmware

 src : Source for the 'librcpod' library, providing higher level interfaces
       to rcpod's commands. This is based on libusb, so it should be portable
       to any OS supported by it, including linux, various BSDs, and Darwin.

 test : Small test programs to demonstrate librcpod


-------- USB permissions

Though libusb supports many operating systems, the information in this section
is specific to Linux. When the rcpod is plugged in, it is enumerated and a file
is created in /proc/bus/usb to represent this device. libusb will find this file
and use it to communicate with the rcpod. Unlike a normal device node in /dev/*,
any permission changes you make will be lost when the device is unplugged. There
are multiple solutions to this...

 - Always run applications using librcpod as root.
   Not the greatest solution...

 - Mount the USB device filesystem world read-write.
   This is very bad for anything other than a single user machine and won't
   work under all kernels, but is barely worth mentioning.
   Add a parameter like 'devmode=0666' to the /etc/fstab line for /proc/bus/usb.

 - Find the device node being used, and change its permissions each time the
   rcpod is plugged in. This is tedious, but not bad if you hardly ever expect
   to unplug the rcpod.
   
   Use 'lsusb' to find the bus and device number the rcpod has been assigned.
   This should be the line containing "ID e461:0002". Look for a file in the
   path /proc/bus/usb/<bus number>/<device number>, and change its permissions
   as needed.

 - Set up the hotplug utilities to automatically change the device's permissions.
   This is the preferred method.

   Add a line like the following to /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap:

      rcpod 0x0003 0xe461 0x0002 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00 0x00

   And write a shell script like the following to /etc/hotplug/usb/rcpod:

      #!/bin/bash
      if [ "$ACTION" = add ] && [ -f "$DEVICE" ]; then
         chown root:users "$DEVICE"
         chmod ug+rw "$DEVICE"
      fi

   (make sure it has execute permissions)
   Restart the hotplug daemon, and try plugging in and unplugging the rcpod.
   Shortly after plugging it in, its file in /proc/bus/usb should be set to
   the proper permissions.
