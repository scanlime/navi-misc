  <section title="What is it?">
    DCOM is a complex subsystem of Windows that certain programs make heavy use
    of, in particular <b>InstallShield</b> which will not always work correctly
    with Wines built in DCOM. Therefore to install some programs you may need to
    first install native DCOM, which Microsoft makes available as a standalone
    installer.

  <section title="How to install">
    * Download <a
    href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/1/3/d13cd456-f0cf-4fb2-a17f-20afc79f8a51/DCOM98.EXE">DCOM98</a> from Microsoft

    * Then run it like this: <type> WINEDLLOVERRIDES=ole32,oleaut32,rpcrt4=n wine DCOM98.EXE </type>

    * It will spit out quite a lot of fixmes and errs as it installs,
      you can ignore these, they are harmless.

    * Now put native overrides for ole32, oleaut32, and rpcrt4 into
      your <l>ConfigFile</l>.
