  <section title="What is this section for?">
    Sometimes interesting patches are written but not applied by
    Alexandre. Maybe they're incomplete, maybe they're wrong, maybe
    they'd break other parts of the code or maybe they're blocked on
    some other piece of work that isn't done yet.

    This page can be used to keep track of them, so we can remember to
    try and get them accepted in future.
