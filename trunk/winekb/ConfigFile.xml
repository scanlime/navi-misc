  <section title="What is it?">
    The config file controls Wines operation and lets you set particular settings on a per-app basis.  It's in the
    process of being removed in favour of a graphical configuration utility (you can still edit the config file using a
    text editor in the registry though), but that isn't finished yet.
  </section>

  <section title="Writing one">
    By default you won't have a config file. So create an empty one. It should look like this:

        WINE REGISTRY Version 2

        [Version]
        ;"Windows"="win2k"

    The ; mark means that line is commented out or disabled. Sometimes you'll find programs that require Windows 2000,
    and others only run on Windows 9x, so you can use that setting to toggle between them. Remember to disable it when
    you don't need it though!

  <section title="DLL Overrides">
    To make Wine use a real DLL instead of one of the builtin versions (which may be incomplete/buggy/etc) first you
    must install that DLL, typically by copying it from a real Windows drive then registering it:

    <type> cp /mnt/cdrive/windows/system32/quartz.dll ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system </type>
    <type> regsvr32 ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system/quartz.dll </type>

    Remember the second step! It often won't make a difference but sometimes is necessary.

    Now put this in the <b>[DllOverrides]</b> section of your config file:

       [DllOverrides]
       "*quartz"="native, builtin"

    This will make Wine prefer the real thing over its own copies. Beware: you can't do this for many DLLs. You also
    have to know which DLLs make a difference and which don't, so don't be afraid to ask around or check the <a
