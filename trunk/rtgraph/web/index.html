<p>
Rtgraph is a collection of real-time graphing widgets for Gtk 2, written in Python.
It includes widgets for scrolling line graphs, polar graphs, cartesian 3D graphs,
and UI elements for manipulating these graphs.
</p>

<p>
Tweak is a companion module included with rtgraph, for easily building Gtk user
interfaces for manipulating data in real-time. Tweak makes it very easy to bind
a set of python attributes in existing objects to a simple Gtk UI. It is used by
some or rtgtaph's UI components, but is also quite usable on its own.
</p>

<p>
Rtgraph currently includes the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scrolling line graphs</li>
    <li>Polar vector graphs</li>
    <li>3D vector graphs using an isometric view</li>
    <li>All graphs support any number of channels, with automatic or manual coloring</li>
    <li>High level classes for quickly creating a user interface displaying a group of input signals</li>
</ul>

Rtgraph was written by <a href="mailto:micah@picogui.org">Micah Dowty</a>, and is released
under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a>.
