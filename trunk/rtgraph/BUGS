Known bugs for rtgraph:
-----------------------

  - In HScrollGraph-derived widgets, Channel values are polled only as
    frequently as the polling timeout handler runs. This can generate
    inaccurate graphs when the timeout handler is running slower than
    new data is being generated. The Channel class could be extended
    to allow callbacks on setValue. HScrollGraph would then use it to
    store (timestamp, value) tuples that could be graphed accurately
    during the next frame.

  - Updating channel values in the ChannelList widget is slow. It looks
    like gtk insists on redrawing the whole widget when one of the Value
    fields changes.

    Because of this, the Value column in ChannelList is now disabled
    by default. Specify a valueUpdateInterval when creating a ChannelList
    or GraphUI to enable it.

  - Pressing Ctrl-C does not immediately kill a program using rtgraph,
    it merely kills one of the timeout handlers. Catching KeyboardInterrupt
    in the timeout handler doesn't solve this.
    Workaround:
       Set the PYGTK_EXCEPTION_FATAL environment variable to "1"
