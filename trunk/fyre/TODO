* Fyre really needs new stopping conditions, the 'target density' is
  easily confused by spirals and other statistically odd images.
  An easy workaround would be to add a way to limit by iterations
  or wallclock time, but that would be silly.

  Currently, highest on my list of things to try is doing a
  1-D histogram of the values in our HistogramImager- then use that
  to throw out extremes and compute an average samples per bucket
  for the remainder of the image. This would let us have a 'quality'
  parameter that's proportional to samples per bucket.
