CanvasElement.cs:
  * Design & implement the internal layout algorithm
  * Add drawing.  This needs to be able to work both on pixmaps and bitmaps,
	so we can use the same code both for drawing on the canvas and
	creating a drag icon.

Element.cs:
  * Implement XML serialization

Pipeline.cs:
  * This needs lots of design work before implementation can go forward.

PipelineDrawing.cs:
  * Add document extents tracking.  This needs to be able to take feedback
	from the global layout algorithm and the scrollbars, to allow the
	drawing to grow as needed.
  * Add drawing code

PipelineEditor.cs:
  * There's currently some code to set up custom cursors (for the open and
	closed hands that people use for dragging. Unfortunately, they just
	show up as garbage.  It may not be possible to do this with Gtk#
	right now, but it would be nice to get these working.

Plugins all need element-specific implementation
