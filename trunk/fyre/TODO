CanvasElement.cs:
  * Design & implement the internal layout algorithm
  * Add drawing.  This needs to be able to work both on gdk pixmaps and
	System.Drawing.Graphics surfaces (for clean-looking AA diagrams)
	so we can use the same code both for drawing on the canvas and
	creating a drag icon.

Element.cs:
  * Implement XML serialization
  * Implement edge tracking - guid + pad#

Pipeline.cs:
  * This needs lots of design work before implementation can go forward.

PipelineDrawing.cs:
  * Add the ability to track document extents from other classes - for
	example, the navigation image needs to be able to interact with
	the extents in various ways.
  * There's currently some code to set up custom cursors (for the open and
	closed hands that people use for dragging. Unfortunately, they just
	show up as garbage.  It may not be possible to do this with Gtk#
	right now, but it would be nice to get these working.
  * Add drawing code

Plugins all need element-specific implementation
