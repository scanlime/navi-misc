CanvasElement.cs:
  * Design & implement the internal layout algorithm
  * Add drawing. This needs to be able to work both on pixmaps and bitmaps,
	so we can use the same code both for drawing on the canvas and
	creating a drag icon.

Element.cs:
  * Implement XML serialization

Pipeline.cs:
  * This needs lots of design work before implementation can go forward.

PipelineDrawing.cs:
  * Add document extents tracking. This needs to be able to take feedback
	from the global layout algorithm and the scrollbars, to allow the
	drawing to grow as needed.
  * Add drawing code

NavigationImage.cs:
  * Optimize drawing. Right now we just redraw the entire navigation window
	when we move the mouse. This isn't terrible, but it would be much
	nicer to just blit what we need, when we need it. This probably
	involves some tracking to see when/how far the mouse actually moves
	in the context of the window's area.

Plugins all need element-specific implementation
