CanvasElement.cs:
  * Design & implement the internal layout algorithm
  * Add drawing. This needs to be able to work both on pixmaps and bitmaps,
	so we can use the same code both for drawing on the canvas and
	creating a drag icon.

Element.cs:
  * Implement XML serialization

Pipeline.cs:
  * This needs lots of design work before implementation can go forward.

PipelineDrawing.cs:
  * Add document extents tracking. This needs to be able to take feedback
	from the global layout algorithm and the scrollbars, to allow the
	drawing to grow as needed.
  * Add drawing code

Plugins all need element-specific implementation
