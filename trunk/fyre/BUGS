Definitely fix before the next release:

- Fyre has no icon
- The win32 build hasn't been tested in a while, make sure it still
  works with all the new gnet and openexr stuff.

Probably fix before the next release:

- We really ought to go through svn history and make a real ChangeLog
- There's no about box (we need somewhere to put the 1.0)
- The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?

Would be nice to fix, and most of these are simple:

- The bifurcation diagrams only update when they are redrawn,
  such as when your mouse enters or leaves them.

- Errors in opening or saving files aren't reported properly

- The 'save' menu items actually are 'save as' for now

- File dialogs don't remember their previous directory
