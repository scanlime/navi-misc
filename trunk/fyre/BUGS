* The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
  This is probably actually the lack of an index
* There are some remaining problems with the win32 build:
  - Libpng isn't linking correctly. I know this at least breaks
    the about box, and it probably also breaks loading/saving
  - Still untested with OpenEXR
