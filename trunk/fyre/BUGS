Definitely fix before the next release:
        * There are some remaining problems with the win32 build:
                - Resources (for the icon) haven't been implemented in
                  the autoconfiscated build system
                - Cluster support compiles, but it doesn't seem to work at
                  all. In server mode it isn't listening, and in client mode
                  it can't connect to rendering servers. Maybe a gnet problem?
                - Libpng isn't linking correctly. I know this at least breaks
                  the about box, and it probably also breaks loading/saving
                - Still untested with OpenEXR

Probably fix before the next release, definitely for 1.0:
	* Fyre has no icon
	* The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
	  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
	  This is probably actually the lack of an index

Would be nice to fix, and most of these are dead simple:
	* If opening an image on the command line but running in interactive mode,
	  it'll still output to stdout. Should pop up an error message in this case.
