Definitely fix before the next release:
	* The win32 build hasn't been tested in a while, make sure it still
	  works with all the new gnet and openexr stuff.

Probably fix before the next release, definitely for 1.0:
	* Fyre has no icon
	* The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
	  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
	  This is probably actually the lack of an index

Would be nice to fix, and most of these are simple:
	* Errors in opening or saving files aren't reported properly
	* The 'save' menu items actually are 'save as' for now
	* File dialogs don't remember their previous directory

For 2.0:
	* Generalized plugin/graph architecture
