Definitely fix before the next release:

- The win32 build hasn't been tested in a while, make sure it still
  works with all the new gnet and openexr stuff.
- The emblem is put on everything right now, should test for the
  existance of metadata
- If things aren't installed to a prefix, loading the emblem file
  won't work

Probably fix before the next release, definitely for 1.0:

- Fyre has no icon
- The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
- Arbitrary function support?

Would be nice to fix, and most of these are simple:

- Errors in opening or saving files aren't reported properly

- The 'save' menu items actually are 'save as' for now

- File dialogs don't remember their previous directory
