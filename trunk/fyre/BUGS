When the scrollbars are recalculated (for example, after using the navigation
image), they sometimes don't always redraw.

When a user tries to quit with an unsaved pipeline, it asks them if they want
to save.  If they choose 'save' but then cancel the save dialog, it quits the
program.  This should act just like 'cancel' on the 'close without saving?'
dialog (return to the main editing interface).
