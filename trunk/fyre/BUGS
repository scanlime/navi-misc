- Under windows, closing the about box may result
  in a crash inside iterative_map_start_calculation().
  This probably isn't windows-specific, just based

- Changing the foreground/background color while
  using a rendering cluster, in windows, causes a
  crash in _libwsock32_a_iname(). It's possible that
  we're using a freed string somewhere in the networking
  code that's getting trashed by the color picking
  code.

- The Win32 build is still untested with OpenEXR
