Definitely fix before the next release:
	* The win32 build hasn't been tested in a while, make sure it still
	  works with all the new gnet and openexr stuff.

Probably fix before the next release, definitely for 1.0:
	* Fyre has no icon
	* Should write a .desktop file
	* The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
	  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
	  This is probably actually the lack of an index

Would be nice to fix, and most of these are simple:
	* Errors in saving OpenEXR aren't reported
	* If opening an image on the command line but running in interactive mode,
	  it'll still output to stdout. Should pop up an error message in this case.
	* The 'save' menu item in the animation window is 'save as' for now
	* File dialogs don't remember their previous directory

For 2.0:
	* Generalized plugin/graph architecture
