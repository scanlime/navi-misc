* Micah, that dastardly creature, has told gnet that we only want
  IPv4. We really should support both v4 and v6.
* The AVI files exported by Fyre don't play in windows media player.
  Is the exporter broken, or can WMP just not handle uncompressed RGB?
  This is probably actually the lack of an index
* There are some remaining problems with the win32 build:
  - Resources (for the icon) haven't been implemented in
    the autoconfiscated build system
  - Cluster support compiles, but it doesn't seem to work at
    all. In server mode it isn't listening, and in client mode
    it can't connect to rendering servers. Maybe a gnet problem?
  - Libpng isn't linking correctly. I know this at least breaks
    the about box, and it probably also breaks loading/saving
  - Still untested with OpenEXR
