There are two kinds of types - primitives and composites
Primitives are things like float, int, color
Composites are things like matrix, vector, etc

Composites will have an identity based both on the types of their
children and on things like rank, size

There will be a base class 'type' which can represent any type
Types need to have some sort of equivalence model - for instance,
vector(3, float([0,1])) and vector(3, int([0,255])) are both
equivalent to color

The kinds of type coercions we can do will be influenced by the
kinds of optimizations that the compiler is capable of -
converting a matrix->parallelized float opration, for instance

A pad will need to define its type at any level of specificity -
can just be "type", "type" decorated somehow (for something like
iterative, where the only requirement is that the input is the same
as the output), specific types, like float, or something in between
(such as a matrix where the rank is important but not the size)
