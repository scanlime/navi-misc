			 *
			 * For each of these elements which now have all their input pads fulfilled,
			 * we run Check(). These pad types are stored and we refill the list with all
			 * of the elements which are connected to those we just checked. If we check
			 * an "output" pad, we remove it from its list.
			 *
			 * We're done when either the outputs list or our intermediate list is empty.
			 * If it's the latter, we know that our pipeline isn't fully connected.
			 * Any pad connections left over in this case are listed as having no type.
