       The FrameBuffer is divided into two queues:

           uploaded to the device. This queue is advanced in hardware.
           If this queue ever has only a single frame in it, that
           frame will be looped. The oldest frame in the remote
           queue is our 'front buffer'.

         - The local queue. These are frames which are waiting behind
           the hardware queue. New frames always end up here
           first. When adding new frames, you may replace the queue or
           append to it. Replacing is good for interactive
           manipulation, where you need to display the newest state
           immediately, appending is good for animations where you
           want to display many frames at a constant rate.
       
       The front buffer, representing our (delayed) notion of what's
       currently on-screen, is accessable via the 'front' member, and
       it is observable.

       Animation can be supported in multiple ways: the easiest is by
       registering a callback which fires as soon as the local queue
       becomes empty. In this way, it's possible to do low-latency
