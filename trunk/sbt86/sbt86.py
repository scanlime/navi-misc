#
# Experimental DOS 8086 -> C static binary translator.
#
# This isn't a general-purpose static binary translator. That wouldn't
# be possible, since self-modifying code and dynamic branches make it
# impossible to create a static translation of any arbitrary program.
# Instead, this is a toolkit which does *most* of the work in creating
# a static translation of one particular program. You'll still need to
# write some program-specific code in order to fix up any untranslateable
# parts in the binary.
#
# These fixups come in the form of a separate per-program Python file
# where you will create a DOSBinary() class to represent your input
# file, apply patches to that in-memory representation, then generate
# code. The patches can either replace original assembly instructions
# (a 'patch') or add C code which executes just prior to an original
# instruction (a 'hook').
#
# Patches affect the analysis phase, where we discover subroutines and
# figure out which parts of the binary are executable code. So, if you
# stub out a function by patching its first instruction with a 'ret',
# or if you patch out any call sites, no code will be generated for
# that function. If you want to replace an original subroutine with a
# C-language routine, for example, you can patch in a 'ret'
# instruction, then hook the 'ret'.
#
# Requires Python 2.5 and the ndisasm disassembler.
