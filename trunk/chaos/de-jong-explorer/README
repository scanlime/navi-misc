 de Jong Explorer
==================

Introduction
------------

The de Jong Explorer provides a rendering of the Peter de Jong map, with
an interactive GTK+ frontend and a command line interface for easy and
efficient rendering of high-resolution, high quality images.

All the images you can create with this program are based on the simple
Peter de Jong map equations:

   x' = sin(a * y) - cos(b * x)
   y' = sin(c * x) - cos(c * y)

The point (x,y) moves chaotically. The resulting image is a map of the
probability that the point lies within the area represented by each
pixel. As you let the de Jong Explorer render longer, it collects more
samples and this probability map, the image, becomes more accurate.

The resulting probability map is treated as a High Dynamic Range image.
This software includes some image manipulation features that let you
apply linear interpolation and gamma correction at the full internal
precision, producing a much higher quality image than if you tried to
create the same effects using standard image processing tools.
Additionally, Gaussian blurs can be applied to the image using a
stochastic process that produces much more natural-looking images than
most programs, again without losing any of the image's original precision.

Loading and Saving
------------------

Any image saved using the GTK+ frontend or the -o command line option
are standard PNG files containing an extra 'tEXt' chunk with all the
parameters used to create the image. This means the image can be loaded
back in using the -i command line option or the "Parameters -> Load from image"
menu option.

One convenient use of this is to save small low-quality images using the
GUI, then use the -i, -t, -s, and -o options to render very high quality
and/or large images noninteractively.

Dependencies
------------

- GTK+ 2.0
- libglade

Compiling
---------

Nothing fancy, just type 'make'. Currently the i686 architecture is
hardcoded, as on modern intel-compatible machines this gives a major
speed boost. You'll need to change this if you're not on an intel-compatible
machine. This has been tested on an Athlon XP, Pentium 4, and PowerPC G3.
