- Auto-shutoff code. It should go into a sleep mode after some period
  of time with no motion over some threshold, then wake up periodically
  to check for more motion.

- Change the protocol to use a higher serial baud rate to encode pulse-width
  style data, such that each RS-232 byte is actually only one bit of data.
  (This will probably be implemented for the therms first, then ported to this)

- Build a receiver that's a HID device :)

- Noise filtering code in the firmware

- Use a more robust CRC, the 8-bit checksum fails too often
