This is a modified version of the uinput module,
required for force-feedback support in inputpipe-server.
See the new comments in uinput.h for details on implementing
force feedback devices.

NOTE: Starting with linux-2.6.10-rc2-mm4, you don't need
      this. Force feedback support is included in an unmodified
      uinput driver.
