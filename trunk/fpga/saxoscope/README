This is a very simple modular logic analyzer for the Saxo
board from fpga4fun. It consists of a tiny FPGA design which
forwards data from an 8-bit probe to the FX2, and some host
software for Linux.

The host software has multiple small parts that you attach
via pipes on the command line. There is a FIFO data capture
tool which streams raw data to stdout, a tool to convert that
raw data to a Verilog VCD file (viewable with gtkwave) and
an example tool which analyzes Playstation controller and
memory card packets in real-time.

Future work:
  - Windows port of the PC-side tools
  - Support for clock compression in the FPGA, to allow
    capturing at faster clock speeds with less CPU.
