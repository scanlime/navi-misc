The Universal Controller Emulator, version 2
--------------------------------------------

The original Unicone was a USB-attached FPGA which could emulate
various video game controllers, and allow remote operation of
video game consoles over the network with arbitrary input devices.

Unicone2 is a redesign of the Unicone project, with a focus on
simplicity and low-latency. It consists of a 'remote' unit which
transmits video game controller signals over cat5 cable, and a
'base' unit which receives those signals and emulates several
controllers. The base unit may optionally provide enhanced
features such as macros or a cross-bar switch.

Unicone was originally implemented for Game Cube controllers. The
first implementation of Unicone2 is for Playstation controllers.
The remote unit is a PIC16F877A microcontroller, and the base
unit is a Parallax Propeller multi-core microcontroller.
