Temporal Hex Dump (THD)
-----------------------

This is still in the early stages of development, but this project
is intended to become a graphical analysis tool for memory access
traces. It is designed to handle very large log files efficiently.

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile, requires scons, wxWidgets 2.8, sqlite3, and Boost 1.38 or
later. Only requires wxWidgets and sqlite3 at runtime.

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, the packages you need are:

  scons
  libsqlite3-dev
  libwxgtk2.8-dev
  wx-common
  libboost-dev

BUGS
----

- The backward iteration in the log instant cache probably doesn't
  quite work 100%, and it's causing discontinuity artifacts when you
  zoom in sometimes.

- The instant cache's vacuum() isn't implemented, so it uses unbounded RAM.

- Slices are supposed to fill in from the cursor outward, but a lot of
  other random slices appear sooner than they should. Maybe this is a
  bug in the cache?

- OnPaint for the timeline control always redraws the whole thing. It
  should only redraw visible areas, and only if they need drawing.

- On zooming in/out, we might want to scale teh buffer bitmap horizontally
  for better visual continuity before the whole thing is loaded.
