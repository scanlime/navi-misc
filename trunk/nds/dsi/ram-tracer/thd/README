Temporal Hex Dump (THD)
-----------------------

This is still in the early stages of development, but this project
is intended to become a graphical analysis tool for memory access
traces. It is designed to handle very large log files efficiently.

The current plan is to implement it in C++ using wxWidgets for the
GUI, and an sqlite3 database to index the log data.
