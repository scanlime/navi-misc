Temporal Hex Dump (THD)
-----------------------

This is still in the early stages of development, but this project
is intended to become a graphical analysis tool for memory access
traces. It is designed to handle very large log files efficiently.

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile, requires scons, wxWidgets 2.8, sqlite3, and Boost 1.38 or
later. Only requires wxWidgets and sqlite3 at runtime.

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, the packages you need are:

  scons
  libsqlite3-dev
  libwxgtk2.8-dev
  wx-common
  libboost-dev
