# RAM Tracer revision 2, constraints and wiring information.
#
# This file contains both the FPGA constraints and some
# human-readable notes about other necessary hookups.
#
# This is designed for use with a bare Spartan 3E chip in the
# PQ208 package. I used the breakout board from Spark Fun electronics:
#
#  http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8458
#
# This design may be adaptable to other FPGAs, but please pay special
# attention to the I/O standards. All DSi memory bus connections must
# use 1.8v logic. In this design, those connections are all made on
# separate I/O banks which take their VccO from the DSi's 1.8v power rail.

# USB interface: FTDI FT2232H Mini Module
#
# http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/EvaluationKits/FT2232H_MiniModule.htm
#

# This module is configured as USB Self-Powered, drawing its 5V
# power from the FPGA board.
#
#    CN2 pins 1,3,5 = V3V3
#    CN2 pins 11,21 + CN3 pins 12,22 = VIO
#    Connect V3V3 and VIO together.
#
#    Ground:    CN3-2
#    VCC (+5v): CN3-3

# All FT2232H connections are made on Bank 2 of the FPGA,
# configured with 3.3v I/O. Port B of the FT2232H is unused,
# since it is unavailable when using the high-speed synchronous
# FIFO. Port A is used in synchronous FIFO mode during normal
# operation, but we also use the FT2232H to configure the FPGA.
#
# During configuration:
#
#    D0-7:     Parallel configuration data from FT2232H to FPGA
#    CSI_B:    Chip select, must be low during configuration
#    RDWR_B:   Read/write, must be  low during configuration
#    CCLK:     Data clock (data latched on rising edge)
#    PROG_B:   Pulse low to reset FPGA. Must be high during config.
#    DONE:     Configuration successful?
#
# We'll use interface A in asynchronous bit-bang mode to actually
# clock out the configuration bitstream. The other relevant pins
# (CSI, RDWR, PROG, DONE) are connected to port B, also in bit-bang mode.
# These pins are connected via 1K series current-limiting resistors.

#  NOTE: All of the GCLK pins on bank 2 are shared with either
#        a data bit or with M2. We can't share with a data bit,
#        so we choose the lesser of two evils.. since M2 needs
#        to be 1 to select slave parallel configuration mode,
#        it's important that our CLKOUT pin is 1 or high-Z when
#        the FPGA starts up. This should be the case.

# Special notes on DSi I/O:
#
#   - ram_clk needs a 330 ohm series resistor.
#     Otherwise, ringing on the clock line can interfere
#     with the RAM's normal operation, and the DSi won't boot.
#
#   - The CE1 line was separated between the RAM and CPU.
#     ram_ce1_in is from the CPU, ram_ce1_out is to the RAM.
#
#   - The FPGA isn't fast enough to forward CE1 from CPU
#     to RAM 100% of the time, so we normally leave
#     ce1_out high-Z and rely on a 330 ohm resistor which
#     was placed between ce1_in and ce1_out. The resistor
#     should be located physically near to the break.
#
# XXX: I should probably include termination resistors for
#      all of these signals, but so far I'm not. If this was
#      a Spartan 3 rather than a 3E, I could use DCI for
#      on-die termination...
