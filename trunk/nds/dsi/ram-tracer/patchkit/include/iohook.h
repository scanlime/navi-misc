 * Low-level I/O: Read or write variable length blocks.

 * IOHook_Send() returns a cookie that can be passed to IOHook_Recv().
 * IOHook_Recv() returns the number of bytes actually read.
 *
 * Both functions always read/write using 32-bit operations,
 * and they always read or write in units of 28 bytes. This
 * is especially important for IOHook_Recv(). You'll need to
 * reserve extra buffer space if your data is not a multiple
 * of 28 bytes.
