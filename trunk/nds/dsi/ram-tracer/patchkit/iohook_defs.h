/*
 * The I/O Hook transmits or receives one 32-byte
 * packet at a time, using a special memory region
 * at IOHOOK_ADDR. This region is observed by the
 * host while parsing memory traces, plus it is
 * patched so that when we read it, we're actually
 * reading a buffer on the FPGA. So reads will not
 * yield the value that was last written.
 *
 * The packet format allows sending or receiving
 * 28 bytes of useful payload at once, with the
 * remaining 32-bit word reserved for identifying
 * the recipient of packets, for including a sequence
 * number that protects against dropped packets and
 * allows polling for new data, and a checksum which
 * protects against bit errors.
