OptParse:
  * Options should be templates so that their data is actually of the right
    type, instead of always being a string
  * It would be nice if the help messages showed what the value should be
    for the <flag><value> pairs, e.g.: -i --infile <file>

TestSuite:
  * Test class represents individual tests
  * TestSuite class represents a groupd of tests
  * TestObserver class watches tests as they're run
