#
# This is a hack to work around the stupid default behavior of Q objects and OR
# operators.  By default, querying (Q(x) | Q(y)) | Q(z) when foreign keys are
# involved will result in some small set of objects, instead of the union of x,
# y and z.

        This helps with race conditions in the database where, between the

        causing us to fail. We'll then execute a get().

        This is still prone to race conditions, but they're even more rare.
