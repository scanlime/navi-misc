""" Observable

This module provides base classes for objects that are observable,
quantities that are observable, and expressions computed with
observable quantities. This is the basis for our rule system- the
trigger for a rule is represented as a composition of observable
quantities, and the rule's action is the observer callback.

The Event class is the basic observable object. It is effectively
a transparent callable proxy that can be observed. By default, all
observers are referenced weakly, so the observer's reference will
never be the only thing preventing an object from being garbage
collected. If your observer is important, make sure there is a
reference to it elsewhere.

For completeness, the Event class was originally written by
Micah Dowty for PyBZEngine, released under the LGPL.

       This event can be called, and all observers will be

       This makes it easy to transparently make a member function
