"""Data structures for building graphs by combining multiple graphs.

A module for manipulating combinatoric graphs. It's easier on memory to keep
the individual graphs separate and pretend that there is a giant graph composed
of all possible combinations of the nodes in the individual graphs. These
classes allow you to manipulate this pretend graph as though it actually
existed in memory.
