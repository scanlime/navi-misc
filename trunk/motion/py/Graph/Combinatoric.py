"""Data structures for building graphs by combining multiple graphs.

A module for manipulating combinatoric graphs. It's easier on memory to keep
the individual graphs separate and pretend that there is a giant graph composed
of all possible combinations of the nodes in the individual graphs. These
classes allow you to manipulate this pretend graph as though it actually
existed in memory.

Classes:
    - Graph
    - AdjacencyList
    - VertexMap
    - EdgeList
