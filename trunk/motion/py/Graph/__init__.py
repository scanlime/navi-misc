"""This is a package for managing graph data structures in python.

It provides an architecture by which graphs can be created with
multiple representations as well as algorithms to operate on
those representations.

Modules:
    - Algorithms        Graph algorithms based on the Algorithm base class
    - Data              Graph representations
    - ExtraAlgorithms   Graph algorithms not based on the Algorithm class
    - Observable        Implementation of the observer pattern
