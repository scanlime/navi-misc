"""A package for creating shuffled dance sequences.

This package handles the dance sequences once they've been loaded from AMC
files. It provides classes for generating chaotic trajectories in both the
Lorenz and Rossler systems, mapping a dance sequence to the trajectory, and
shuffling the sequence.
