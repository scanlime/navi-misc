"""A package for creating shuffled dance sequences.

This package handles the actual dance sequences. It maps them to a chaotic
attractor and shuffles the sequence when given a new set of initial conditions.

Modules:
    - MotionGraph       Create graphs from a motion corpus
    - ODE               ODE solvers
    - Sequence          Map and shuffle a dance sequence using chaotic trajectories
    - Systems           Chaotic systems used in shuffling
