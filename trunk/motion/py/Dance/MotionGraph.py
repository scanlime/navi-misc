"""A module providing classes for graphs built from a corpus of motion.

A collection of functions and classes used to create graphs built from motion
capture data.  The nodes in the graph represent a range of positions for a
single joint.  Edges in the graph have a probability associated with them,
indicating the likelihood that the transition from u to v along that edge
occured in the corpus of motion capture data.
