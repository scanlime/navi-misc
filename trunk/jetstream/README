Insert some insightful rubbish here

To compile it, you will need:

  - SDL
  - PicoGUI server (pgserver)
  - PicoGUI theme compiler (themec)
  - Python 2.2
  - PicoGUI Python client library (cli_python)
  - FMOD sound library (Currently disabled)
  - OpenGL
  - libpng
  - libjpeg
  - freetype2 (version 2.1.3 recommended)
  - Boost.Python

Notes:

  - This app requires specific options to be enabled in
    the picogui server. If in doubt, you can ./configure
    your pgserver with a line like:

    ./configure --with-profile=/path/to/jetstream/pgserver-profile

  - You have to enable OpenGL support for the PicoGUI theme compiler:

    ./configure --enable-opengl

  - FMOD is not open source. It will be eventually replaced
    with an alternative, like OpenAL
    (Update: FMOD support is currently disabled)

  - The path to the python library is hardcoded in the makefile.
    It works on Gentoo, you might need to change it on other distros
    as it hasn't been tested.
