# ~/.trough/properties
#
# Introduction
# -------------------------------
# Configure properties for all or parts of trees here.
# The properties are read from an array (in python syntax) of tuples of the
# form:
#
#  	[(path1, (key1, value1)),
#	 (path2, (key2, value2)),
#	  ...]
#
# All properties are applied recursively, and in the order they are listed
# in the array.  The directory tree is stored without these properties, so
# that tree refreshes have no effect upon the properties; these properties
# are applied to the tree just before the tree is converted to a playlist
# internally.
#
# Useful Keys
# -------------------------------
# The keys listed below change the tree parsing behavior for the given path.
# Other keys will not
# result in an error, but will likely have no effect on output from the program.
#
# format:
# Specifies the format of subdirectories.  There is no effect if the path
# leads to a file.
#     Valid values:
#	'All':	Files in each directory are grouped together.
#	'Navi':	If all files in the directory are numbered, they are grouped
#		together, otherwise they are separated.
#	'None': Files in each directory are grouped separately.
#     Default is 'Navi'.
#
# mask:
# A mask prevents anything inside the path from being selected for the playlist.
# Masked files will be ignored (and so skipped) when the tree is converted to a
# playlist.  Masked directories will still be searched for unmasked files.
#     Valid values:
#	True:	 Apply the mask to the directory
#	False:	 Remove masks from the directory
#     Default is False.
