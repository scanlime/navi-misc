""" RioKarma.Filesystem

This module implements a local model of the Rio's filesystem, including
objects for an in-memory model and a persistent cache implemented with
an sqlite database. This filesystem model must be used to do anything
useful with the rio: when uploading files we need to be able to allocate
file IDs, and before downloading a file we need its ID. The model
synchronizes with the device, then it can be queried for existing files
or IDs to use for new files.

    """This is a data structure for keeping track of unused areas of an
       abstract address space, marking areas as used, and looking for unused
       areas. It is a binary tree, with maximum depth equal to the number
       of bits in the address space. Every node (represented by a list) can
       either lead to another node or to a boolean indicating whether that
       space is used.

       If the tree were fully populated, it would be no better than a lookup
       table holding a flag for every address, scanned linearly every time we
       wanted to find an available one. To avoid this, the tree is optimized-
       a node with leaves for both children may only exist if the leaves have
       different values. Initially the tree's root node is a False leaf,
       indicating that the entire address space is empty. When we allocate
       space, leaves split into nodes as necessary. When traversing the tree
       looking for available space, this lets us jump over large blocks of
       unavailable space very quickly. This is very similar to the Karnaugh
       maps used to optimize simple digital logic circuits.
