- Split demo.py into separate useful utilities
- Write a spiffy synchronization app
- Create another local database to store play counts, profiles, and such
  for each song. This database will be synchronized from the device, and used
  when uploading new songs that have already been on the device at some point,
  so that play counts and profiles aren't destroyed when re-uploading music.
