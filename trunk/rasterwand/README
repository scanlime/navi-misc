This is a somewhat silly project- an off the shelf wiggling-LED-style
clock was purchased, and subsequently modified to be a USB peripheral.

The clock in question is basically a cheap clone of the ones
sold at http://www.fantazein.com/

You can see some images of the prototype in action at:
http://navi.cx/images/hardware/rasterwand/

The original clock consisted of several parts:

  - A wand with 8 LEDs, connected to the main PCB with a flexible cable.
    The wand is mounted on a spring, and can be pushed in one direction
    by an electromagnet.

  - Output driver electronics for the LEDs and magnet

  - An IR LED/phototransistor interruption switch, to sense when the wand
    passes a certain point. The sensor is mounted off-center.

  - Lots of uninteresting clock-related circuitry and power supply bits

All the clock-related and power supply parts were removed and replaced
with a PIC16C745 microcontroller. The microcontroller has a few important jobs:

  - Monitor the interruption sensor output and use it to create a real-time
    prediction of the wand's current angle
    
  - Use the angle prediction to turn the electromagnet on at the right time
  
  - Use the angle prediction to display an image from double-buffered RAM on the LEDs
  
  - Listen for USB commands that modify the display and the timing parameters

This project consists of PC-side code, firmware, and reverse engineering notes.
The PC-side code is GPL'ed. The most important parts of the firmware are LGPL'ed,
with the USB interface code from Microchip under its original license.
