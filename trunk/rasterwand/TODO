Firmware:

- Interleaved 4-byte write (page flip resets pointer)

- Non-interleaved 12-byte write?

- Add a watchdog mode bit: if the current sync edge timer is greater than
  the current period and the watchdog bit is on, the display and coil modes
  would be cleared.
  This prevents the LEDs from overheating if the host isn't paying attention
  and the wand stalls. Making it a mode bit makes it easy to disable for
  debugging or special effects.
