Firmware:

- Add a way to set the period without modifying the phase. Maybe this
  could be done if phase == 0xFFFF.
- Sync bit enables period/phase calculation, but edges are still sampled

- Use a page flip counter rather than a page flip busy bit, so that page
   flips can be reliably detected even when receiving interrupt packets
   that lag the actual registers slightly.

- Display bit enables/disables actual LED drive, but timing calculations
  always run. This would keep the first frame after enabling from being
  misaligned.

- Interleaved 4-byte write (page flip resets pointer)

- Non-interleaved 12-byte write?

- Use the PIC's watchdog, clrwdt in display_poll

- In addition to column width, add an optional blank width to put
  after each column for implementing dotted rather than continuous scans

- Add a watchdog mode bit: if the current sync edge timer is greater than
  the current period and the watchdog bit is on, the display and coil modes
  would be cleared.
  This prevents the LEDs from overheating if the host isn't paying attention
  and the wand stalls. Making it a mode bit makes it easy to disable for
  debugging or special effects.

- Add a register for setting the display width, so smaller widths can be
  used to tweak the aspect ratio.
