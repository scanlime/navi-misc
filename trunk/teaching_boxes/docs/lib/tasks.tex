\begin{enumerate}
\item Mrs. Anderson has a completed lesson plan that has proven to work well over
      the years.  She has decided that she would like to share her lesson with
      others so that they may make use of her experiences, information, and
      plans.

\item Mr. Multon is a second-grade physical science teacher for an elementary school.
      He has a lesson for an ``earthquakes'' unit, but needs to plan an activity
      to accompany it.

\item Ms. Frizzle recently taught a lesson she obtained from another teacher.  She
      found some issues with teaching it and would like to make notes on the lesson
      about her findings for next time.

\item Mr. Johnson is planning a lesson to be taught the following week.  He has
      already assembled much of the information he needs, and feels comfortable
      with his plan.  But two days later he finds some resources that he thinks
      would add to his lesson very nicely.  He wants to incorporate the information
      into his plan.

\item George works for the Department of Education and is developing a new content
      standard to be taught at the $5^{th}$ grade level.  He wants to design a
      sample lesson demonstrating how the standard could be fulfilled, and provide
      it to school districts to use.
