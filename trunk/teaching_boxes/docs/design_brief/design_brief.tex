\section{Problem}
The teaching boxes project intends to provide teachers with a digital resource
for lesson plans and materials. Our project's purpose is to create a user
interface for teachers to create and modify lesson plans in this digital
library.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Progress}
As of October 19, 2005, we have interviewed 4 users. Each interview lasted about
thirty minutes.  Currently, we are trying to schedule two more interviews.
According to our schedule, we should have already finished interviewing and
started on our low-fidelity prototype. We will have to push the due date for the
low-fidelity prototype back a week. And rather than having a week to evaluate
the prototype after it is finished, we can evaluate it while we develop it so
that the low-fi prototype is completed and evaluated by October $27^{th}$. Then
we will be back on schedule.

\subsection{Interview Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How do you create lesson plans?
	\item How do you revise lesson plans, and how frequently?
	\item How long does it usually take you to create a lesson plan?
	\item Where do you get ideas for lesson plans?
	\item Where do you find resources for lesson plans?
	\item Do you work collaboratively with other teachers?
	\item What's your biggest concern about using someone else's lesson plans?
\end{itemize}
