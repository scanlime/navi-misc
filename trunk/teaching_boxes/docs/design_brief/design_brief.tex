\section{Problem}
The teaching boxes project intends to provide teachers with a digital resource
for lesson plans and materials. Our project's purpose is to create a user
interface for teachers to create and modify lesson plans in this digital
library.

\section{Methods to Date}
To date we have interviewed 4 users. Each interview lasted about thirty minutes.
Currently, we are trying to schedule two more interviews. According to our
schedule, we should have already finished interviewing and started on our
low-fidelity prototype. We will have to push the due date for the low-fidelity
prototype back a week. And rather than having a week to evaluate the prototype
after it is finished, we can evaluate it while we develop it so that the low-fi
prototype is completed and evaluated by October $27^{th}$. Then we will be back
on schedule.
