\section{Problem}
Teaching boxes are digital collections of lesson plans, activities, and other
resources compiled by teachers. These compilations of materials can be utilized
by other teachers, and the lessons may be modified or added to depending on each
individual teacher's needs. Traditionally, these sets of materials are compiled
in binders or boxes, and commonly become cumbersome to use due to the amount of
material they contain.  In the Teaching Boxes Builder project, materials are
compiled and organized digitally to reduce the clumsiness of compiling large
quantities of teaching material.

Much of the digital Teaching Boxes design work is being done by DLESE (Digital
Library for Earth System Education, http://preview.dlese.org/). DLESE has a
pilot website for the digital teaching boxes\cite{bib:teachingboxes.org}.

One of the primary issues surrounding the design of digital teaching boxes is
ease of creation.  Although a teacher may have a clear lesson plan, making this
lesson and related materials available on-line has thus far been something of a
challenge.  At the present time, the teacher creates the teaching box in
Microsoft Word using a template and then sends Word document to an intermediary.
The intermediary then generates HTML from the Word document and uploads the
teaching box to the web-server. Similarly, modifying a teaching box can not be
done directly. A teacher must send the changes to someone who can propagate the
changes to the teaching box on the website.

We propose to implement a user-friendly, flexible way to allow teachers to
create teaching boxes and modify them directly. Utilizing a template provided on
the website, teachers will be able to create brand new teaching boxes that will
be immediately available to other users. It will be possible to store partially
created lessons for completion at a later time, and to modify existing teaching
boxes. The interface will need to make all the necessary steps in the creation
process clear to new users without bogging down expert users.

\section{Approach}
We began by interviewing teachers about lesson planning -- interview questions
can be found in Appendix \ref{interview questions}, and notes in Appendix
\ref{interview notes}. The interviews helped us gather data regarding how
teachers create lesson plans and what requirements they have for digitizing
lesson plans. This data was used to create some low-fidelity prototypes for
various aspects of the user interface. We put these prototypes through cognitive
walk-throughs and heuristic evaluations to try and improve their design before
we began any actual coding. After evaluating the low-fidelity prototype, we
created a functioning high-fidelity prototype based on our low-fidelity
mock-ups. The high-fidelity prototype was created using XHTML, JavaScript, CSS,
and AJAX. After this prototype was complete we went back to our interviewees to
have them evaluate it. We had test users perform think-alouds on this prototype.
The feedback gathered from the think-alouds was then used to improve the
high-fidelity prototype and create a finished project.

\section{Abstract User Profile}
In general, our users are teachers of any grade level -- Kindergarten through
12$^{th}$ grade. They should be familiar enough with a computer to be able to
perform basic tasks: sending and receiving e-mail, browsing the Internet, or
using a word processor. The user does not necessarily need to be familiar with
the system, but a basic understanding of the teaching boxes concept is
preferred.

\section{Design Priorities \& Issues}
From our user interviews and discussions with our sponsors we have identified
the following priorities and concerns for this project.

\subsection{Priorities}
The user interface needs to allow teachers to create digital lessons and
teaching boxes in a non-linear fashion. That is, it should not enforce an order
for the process, users should be allowed to fill in information in any order
they choose. The interface also needs to provide mechanisms for uploading files
to attach to the lesson so that teachers can include resources -- such as
worksheets -- with the lesson. Teachers should also be allowed to create links
to other lessons in the system or external web resources.

Once created, a lesson needs to be editable. As time goes on lessons are
modified and improved, so teachers need to be able to modify the digital
lessons. This also relates to the non-linearity of the interface; teachers can
begin a lesson, save it, and come back to finish it at a later date by choosing
to edit the partially complete lesson. Certain common template fields such as
materials and standards addressed should be provided by the interface. This will
help bring some structure to lessons written by different teachers and make it
easier to use and understand the lessons that a user didn't write. As well as
a number of common template fields, the interface should provide a means for
entering information not provided for by the template fields because we cannot
forsee every possible piece of information a teacher might want to include in a
lesson.

Finally, it is vital that this interface be simple and intuitive. All fields and
buttons should be clearly labeled so that their function or purpose is easily
discernable. The process of digitizing a lesson for sharing via this library
should be as painless as possible so that teachers are not dissuaded from
sharing their materials.

\subsection{Issues}
Activities are conceptually different from lessons. Activities are rarely
lessons in and of themselves, but frequently supplement lessons. However,
we found from our interviews that planning an activity is often quite similar to
planning a lesson; the process is often the same, some of the fields --
materials, procedure, goal, etc. -- overlap, and activities are usually
developed along with a lesson. The question that arises here is whether or not
to treat activities and lessons differently by giving them separate interfaces.
It might be confusing for users if there is no logical separation in the
interface between lesson plans and activities. But there is a risk of
duplicating much of the interface by providing separate interfaces for each.

Because creating a digital lesson can be a fairly complex task, there is a lot
of information for the user: both the information that they have entered and the
actions that they can perform on the lesson need to be visible to the user.
Thus, information visibility is a concern for this interface. We do not want to
overwhelm the user with choices and text that they've entered. But at the same
time, we do not want to make it difficult for a user to find information that
they are looking for.

Although the interface will provide a means for teachers to upload
``attachments'' to a lesson or box, there are other resources for which this is
not an adequate solution. Text books, and other hard copy resources cannot be
uploaded in this fashion. It might be possible to scan the required pages in if
there are few enough. But there needs to be some mechanism for handling
non-digital resources in lessons and boxes so that teachers are not limited to
what is already on a computer or what they can scan.
