\section{Problem}
Teaching boxes are digital collections of lesson plans, activities, and other
resources compiled by teachers. These compilations of materials can be utilized
by other teachers, and the lessons may be modified or added to depending on each
individual teacher's needs. Traditionally, these sets of materials are compiled
in binders or boxes, and commonly become cumbersome to use due to the amount of
material they contain.  In the Teaching Boxes Builder project, materials are
compiled and organized digitally to reduce the clumsiness of compiling large
quantities of teaching material.

Much of the digital Teaching Boxes design work is being done by DLESE (Digital
Library for Earth System Education, http://preview.dlese.org/). DLESE has a
pilot website for the digital teaching boxes\cite{bib:teachingboxes.org}.

One of the primary issues surrounding the design of digital teaching boxes is
ease of creation.  Although a teacher may have a clear lesson plan, making this
lesson and related materials available on-line has thus far been something of a
challenge.  At the present time, the teacher creates the teaching box in
Microsoft Word using a template and then sends Word document to an intermediary.
The intermediary then generates HTML from the Word document and uploads the
teaching box to the web-server. Similarly, modifying a teaching box can not be
done directly. A teacher must send the changes to someone who can propagate the
changes to the teaching box on the website.

We propose to implement a user-friendly, flexible way to allow teachers to
create teaching boxes and modify them directly. Utilizing a template provided on
the website, teachers will be able to create brand new teaching boxes that will
be immediately available to other users. It will be possible to store partially
created lessons for completion at a later time, and to modify existing teaching
boxes. The interface will need to make all the necessary steps in the creation
process clear to new users without bogging down expert users.

\section{Related Research}
We decided to draw upon the already available resources for this project, since
a significant amount of information about this topic has already been researched
by the project sponsors.  We closely examined two of their papers alongside
looking closely at the web sites that have already been designed and other
teaching lesson websites.  In \textit{Teaching Boxes: Lessons for Digital
Library Resource Reuse}\cite{bib:khan-maull} the authors explore the components
which should be included within teaching boxes, and examine how the concept of
teaching boxes can be modified to support teachers in the most accessible way
possible, specifically as part of their current lesson-planning methods.
Several pilot studies were run to define teaching boxes and to examine which
views of the box were most useful.  One of the key findings was the necessity
for extensive flexibility and adaptation for any given teacher.  The pilot
studies also found that teachers wanted detail about the lesson plans, including
time required, materials, and common student misconceptions about the subject
matter.  One important note at the end of the article is that it would be
helpful to connect teaching boxes to each other.  This is an idea we have
attempted to implement into our current design.

In \textit{Customizable Teaching Boxes: A Window to Digital Library Resource
Reuse} \cite{bib:khan-maull2} the authors utilized Lewis and Rieman's
task-centered design approach to examine teaching boxes in a similar fashion
that it was used in this project.  They examined the design of teaching boxes
from the perspective of lesson-planning work flow, look at how often and in what
matter teachers modified the lessons, and studied how they would modify and
reuse lesson plans.  They found, as we did, that teachers rarely used prepared
lessons as is, and instead extensively modified these lessons.  This finding
formed the base of our project: designing an easily modifiable, intuitively
navigable teaching box.

\section{Approach}
We began by interviewing teachers about lesson planning -- interview questions
can be found in Appendix \ref{interview questions}, and notes in Appendix
\ref{interview notes}. The interviews helped us gather data regarding how
teachers create lesson plans and what requirements they have for digitizing
lesson plans. This data was used to create some low-fidelity prototypes for
various aspects of the user interface. We put these prototypes through cognitive
walk-throughs and heuristic evaluations to try and improve their design before
we began any actual coding. After evaluating the low-fidelity prototype, we
created a functioning high-fidelity prototype based on our low-fidelity
mock-ups. The high-fidelity prototype was created using XHTML, JavaScript, CSS,
and AJAX. After this prototype was complete we went back to our interviewees to
have them evaluate it. We had test users perform think-alouds on this prototype.
The feedback gathered from the think-alouds was then used to improve the
high-fidelity prototype and create a finished project.

\section{Interviews}
\input{interview_summary}

\section{Abstract User Profile}
In general, our users are teachers of any grade level -- Kindergarten through
12$^{th}$ grade. They should be familiar enough with a computer to be able to
perform basic tasks: sending and receiving e-mail, browsing the Internet, or
using a word processor. The user does not necessarily need to be familiar with
the system, but a basic understanding of the teaching boxes concept is
preferred.

\section{Design Priorities \& Issues}
From our user interviews and discussions with our sponsors we have identified
the following priorities and concerns for this project.

\subsection{Priorities}
The user interface needs to allow teachers to create digital lessons and
teaching boxes in a non-linear fashion. That is, it should not enforce an order
for the process, users should be allowed to fill in information in any order
they choose. The interface also needs to provide mechanisms for uploading files
to attach to the lesson so that teachers can include resources -- such as
worksheets -- with the lesson. Teachers should also be allowed to create links
to other lessons in the system or external web resources.

Once created, a lesson needs to be editable. As time goes on lessons are
modified and improved, so teachers need to be able to modify the digital
lessons. This also relates to the non-linearity of the interface; teachers can
begin a lesson, save it, and come back to finish it at a later date by choosing
to edit the partially complete lesson. Certain common template fields such as
materials and standards addressed should be provided by the interface. This will
help bring some structure to lessons written by different teachers and make it
easier to use and understand the lessons that a user didn't write. As well as
a number of common template fields, the interface should provide a means for
entering information not provided for by the template fields because we cannot
foresee every possible piece of information a teacher might want to include in a
lesson.

Finally, it is vital that this interface be simple and intuitive. All fields and
buttons should be clearly labeled so that their function or purpose is easily
discernible. The process of digitizing a lesson for sharing via this library
should be as painless as possible so that teachers are not dissuaded from
sharing their materials.

\subsection{Issues}
\label{sec: issues}
Activities are conceptually different from lessons. Activities are rarely
lessons in and of themselves, but frequently supplement lessons. However,
we found from our interviews that planning an activity is often quite similar to
planning a lesson; the process is often the same, some of the fields --
materials, procedure, goal, etc. -- overlap, and activities are usually
developed along with a lesson. The question that arises here is whether or not
to treat activities and lessons differently by giving them separate interfaces.
It might be confusing for users if there is no logical separation in the
interface between lesson plans and activities. But there is a risk of
duplicating much of the interface by providing separate interfaces for each.

Because creating a digital lesson can be a fairly complex task, there is a lot
of information for the user: both the information that they have entered and the
actions that they can perform on the lesson need to be visible to the user.
Thus, information visibility is a concern for this interface. We do not want to
overwhelm the user with choices and text that they've entered. But at the same
time, we do not want to make it difficult for a user to find information that
they are looking for.

Although the interface will provide a means for teachers to upload
``attachments'' to a lesson or box, there are other resources for which this is
not an adequate solution. Text books, and other hard copy resources cannot be
uploaded in this fashion. It might be possible to scan the required pages in if
there are few enough. But there needs to be some mechanism for handling
non-digital resources in lessons and boxes so that teachers are not limited to
what is already on a computer or what they can scan.

The interface provides the user with a number of common fields such as
``Methods'' and ``Materials''. These predefined fields are not always sufficient
for a lesson; a teacher might want to include information not accounted for by
these fields. It is important to allow teachers to enter whatever information
they deem important for the lesson, so a means of creating custom fields in a
lesson is required. But we want to discourage teachers from using these fields
exclusively because then the common structure of lessons is lost. We do not want
a teacher creating a custom field for ``Methods'' simply because they call it
``Procedure'' and don't recognize that that is what is meant by ``Methods''.

\section{Tasks}
The following user tasks are intended to exemplify the uses of the system and
the different types of users who might find the system useful. The tasks were
derived from our user interviews.

\input{tasks}

\section{Design Approach}
Figure \ref{fig: main window} shows the main window for creating new digital
lessons. It presents the user with individual labeled text areas. These labels
will help a user identify the type of information expected in the text field.
Wherever the title might not be sufficient or ambiguous, a brief description of
the field will be provided next to the title. These text fields help to add
structure to the lessons so that all lessons will be somewhat similar in format
and thus familiar and more usable.

Certain fields are optional and have a link that allows the user to remove them
from the lesson. Above the text entries is a toolbar providing the user with
formatting options and buttons with which the user can manipulate the lesson.
The area containing the text entries scrolls, but the toolbar does not. This
should make as much of the system visible to the user as possible. In many cases
it will not be feasible to display all the fields of a lesson at once, but they
are all kept on one page and should be easy to find by scrolling. The toolbar is
always available at the top, so the user never has to search the page to find
the buttons they desire. All of the buttons in the toolbar will be labeled with
text and an icon. Icons do not always clearly indicate the action performed, a
combination of descriptive text and an icon should improve a user's ability to
identify the correct button. The exception to this rule is the formatting
buttons. Formatting buttons for bold, or italic fonts, etc. are common in many
applications and will most likely be familiar to the user. In the interest of
space, these buttons only make use of icons.

There is a link at the top of this page leading to help and documentation files.
Often help buttons and menus are unhelpful; they contain either little
information, or detailed information that doesn't pertain to what most users are
interested in. This might dissuade many users from making use of a help button.
Our hope is that a link with more descriptive text about the kind of help it
provides will be less dissuasive for users in need of help.

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../../low-fi_prototype/button_mouseover}
	\caption{The basic main window for a new digital lesson.}
	\label{fig: main window}
\end{figure}

The interface for creating and modifying a teaching box (Figure \ref{fig: new box}
is even more simple than that of a new lesson. Internally, teaching boxes are
just a collection of links to lessons. There are links allowing the user to
remove one or all of the lessons contained in the box. The box contains a text
area for entering a brief description of the box that should give other users an
idea of what the box is about. The only button available to the user in the
toolbar allows the user to add another lesson to the box. Boxes are simple
enough that they can be saved automatically when the user makes a change, rather
than being explicitly saved.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../../low-fi_prototype/teaching_box}
	\caption{The teaching box interface.}
	\label{fig: new box}
\end{figure}

The teaching boxes interface makes heavy use of dialog windows to display
additional information to the user and present them with more detailed choices.
The information in the dialog boxes is only needed by the user on rare
occasions, so most of the time it is not visible. This should help reduce
clutter on the screen and make more frequently needed information more visible.

Figure \ref{fig: dialogs} shows all of the dialogs used in this interface. When
the user elects to create a new lesson, they are presented with Figure
\ref{fig: new lesson dialog}. This dialog window allows the user to choose
additional fields to initially include in the lesson plan in addition to the
five required fields. Underneath the list of available fields the dialog
displays a brief description of the highlighted field so that if the user is
unclear about what a field is for they have more information available.

Figure \ref{fig: new field} is similar to Figure \ref{fig: new lesson dialog}. A
user is not limited to the fields with which they create a lesson, they may add
more fields later. This dialog allows the user to add fields to a lesson that
has already been created. Like the dialog in Figure \ref{fig: new lesson dialog},
this dialog provides a description of each field for the user below the list of
fields.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Cognitive Walk-through}
A number of problems were identified during the cognitive walk-through.  We
identified that we needed more possible boxes, including potentially ones where
a teacher could label them himself because we could not identify all of the
sections that a teacher may want to use in their lesson plan.  Another problem
was clarity and consistency about what goes into each of the sections in a
teaching box.  The titles of the boxes and what information needed to be
included in them needed to be specified more clearly, and there are a number of
ways this can be addressed, all involving giving the user more information about
the box sub-area as it's being created and edited.  The important issue of how
the information was going to be saved was brought up, as well: how do teachers
save teaching boxes, and how frequently is saving the box necessary?  Another
concern was how teacher were going to upload materials such as worksheets to the
boxes, and the need to make this as clear as possible.  Additionally,
referencing other teaching boxes would be helpful, but could be confusing for
teachers.  It would be good to add a link near the requisite "standards this
lesson meets" box to some sort of guide to the governmental standards.

\subsection{Heuristic Evaluation}
The heuristic evaluation revealed many of the same difficulties as the cognitive
walk-through as well as a handful of new ones.  The aforementioned problem about
what to name each subsection of the lesson plan was one concern, slightly
broadened in this evaluation to consider the fact that different teachers might
call different subsections different things.  Not only do we need to be
explicitly clear, we may need to call different sub-areas multiple names.  On
the other hand, that might get very confusing.  We also realized that the user
memory load of our initial design, that of having each box nested within a
larger lesson plan, might be more confusing that it needed to be because the
lack of visibility of the subsections could tax memory load substantially.
Consistency and feedback did not appear to be issues in our design, exits were
easy to spot, and error messages seem to only be relevant when uploading
additional materials such as worksheets to the site, a feature we have not yet
designed into the interface.

\section{Final Design}
For our final design we drew heavily on the DLESE website \cite{bib:preview} and
the prototype site for teaching boxes \cite{bib:teachingboxes.org}. From these
sites we gleaned the fields needed for our interface and created a look and feel
for the interface that would fit well with the existing project. We attempted to
make it as easy as possible to integrate this interface with the teaching boxes
project.

Our final design followed our low-fidelity prototype fairly closely. We used
JavaScript overlays for the dialog boxes (Figures \ref{fig: new lesson ss} and
\ref{fig: new box ss}, for example) so that the dialogs would be visible even
when the user has pop-ups disabled in their browser. We considered using a
sophisticated widget toolkit to build the interface and rejected the idea in
favor of a more simple approach. We use only standard HTML components in
conjunction with JavaScript and CSS to create the interface. This forced us to
use a simple design for the interface. It is our hope that more complex boxes
and lessons can be created by combining the simple aspects of the interface.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/new_lesson}
	\caption{Dialog presented when creating a new lesson.}
	\label{fig: new lesson ss}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig: blank lesson ss} shows a newly created blank lesson with some
text. Formatting options for each text area are provided beneath the text area;
formatting options are not available for all fields -- such as ``Author'' -- so
they only appear below an entry when they are available. Beneath the name of
each field a brief description of what the field should contain is displayed.
Next to each field name is a link that removes the field from the lesson, if the
field is removable. The user is asked to verify the removal of a field before it
is removed (Figure \ref{fig: remove prompt ss}).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/formatting}
	\caption{A new lesson shown with some formatted text.}
	\label{fig: blank lesson ss}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/remove_prompt}
	\caption{Prompt presented when a user clicks ``Remove''.}
	\label{fig: remove prompt ss}
\end{figure}

The toolbar -- Figure \ref{fig: toolbar ss} -- displays text and icons for each
button. Some icons, such as the icons for ``New Lesson'' and ``Save Lesson'',
are taken from other applications that use those icons for the same action;
hopefully the icons are recognizable because of that. Other icons, such as ``Add
to Box'', are meant to directly relate to the action they perform so that their
function is easy to recognize. In case the icons are not enough to determine a
button's action, there is text next to the button that displays the button's
function. Should the text and icon not be enough, tooltips are displayed when
the cursor is placed over a button.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/toolbar}
	\caption{Toolbar.}
	\label{fig: toolbar ss}
\end{figure}

\section{User Testing}
We are still trying to set up times to meet with users for the think-aloud;
however, the protocol is rather straightforward.  Using the methods of Lewis and
Rieman, we will ask participants to think aloud as they perform a given task.
The user will be asked to begin at http://lorien.navi.cx:8000/teaching\_boxes/
and create a new lesson, one that they commonly teach.  Once they have created a
lesson, their next step will be to add a field that they "forgot" into the
lesson, and to make a note for themselves to go back and change something at a
future date.  The user will then be asked to link to a preexisting-existing lesson that
we've uploaded onto the server.  Once the lesson is created, they'll be asked to
save it for future use (although the actual "save" feature may not be
functional).  This walk-through should be rather short compared to the
walk-throughs we did for class exercises, primarily because of the limited
number of tasks available in this particular interface design.

After the think-aloud, users will be asked a number of questions.  These include
the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What part or parts of Teaching Boxes did you find the most rewarding?
\item What part or parts did you find the most difficult or frustrating?
\item Looking at Teaching Boxes builder the way it is today, do you think you'd
      use it to design your lesson plans?
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \item If so, why, and if not, why not?
	  \item If so, in what ways do you think you would you use it?
	  \end{itemize}
\item On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the most satisfied and 1 the least, how
      would you rate your overall experience with Teaching Boxes?
\item One a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the most similar and 1 the least, how would
      you rank the degree of similarity of Teaching Boxes to other on-line
      lesson-planning resources you've used?
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}
This project focused primarily on the interface used for creating new digital
teaching boxes and lessons. As a result, there is some missing functionality
such as the ability to save a lesson or box, or search for a lesson or box. Our
intent for this project was to store the lessons and boxes in XML files on the
server. However, for the purpose of searching it might be best to store them in
a database.

Additionally, we raised some issues in Section \ref{sec: issues} that were not
addressed in this project. Our interface does not address the hard copy
resources issue. Teachers can scan these resources to upload them, or create a
note in the lesson citing the resource, but these are simply workarounds that
don't really address the problem. No decision was made about whether the
existing functionality is sufficient to manage these types of resources, or
whether something more should be provided.

Another unaddressed issue is that of the custom field. Further research into the
dangers of providing a customizable field should be performed before committing
to that solution. If it turns out that the custom field is being overused at the
expense of predefined fields, an alternate solution should be provided for users
who find that none of the available fields are adequate for some portion of a
given lesson.

Finally, we considered the need for user documentation for this project, but
provided none. Good documentation that is easy to find is essential to this
project. In addition to documentation describing teaching boxes and the
interface created in this project, we feel that a tutorial on creating a new
lesson and creating a teaching box should be provided.

\section{Web Analytics}
We identified two major ``business'' goals for this project: we want teachers to
contribute resources to the library, and add their lessons to the library. Both
of these goals are related to one another, but separated here so that they can
be observed individually to balance them. We would like teachers to add
resources to lessons they didn't create, as well as adding them to ones they
created.

\subsection{Control Metrics}
A simple control metric for monitoring contributed resources is simply the
number of uploads that have failed. If there are a high number of failed
uploads, there is probably something wrong with the system that is preventing
users from uploading.

For monitoring lesson/box creation we can again simply count the number of
lessons/boxes created. In addition, we can count the number of lesson/box views
per user and compare that to how many lessons/boxes they create. This will give
us an idea of how many lessons a user creates on average vs. how much they
utilize the library. If this number is too low to provide a library big enough
for our taste, something needs to be done to motivate people to contribute
lessons. Another useful metric for this goal is how many lessons a user viewed
before creating their first lesson or box. Given enough users, this should give
some indication of how long an average user needs to utilize the library before
beginning to contribute to it.

\subsection{Analytic Metrics}
The number of resources uploaded compared to the number of lessons in the
library can be used to determine how much difficulty users have uploading
resources. Assuming that the reason few resources are contributed is not because
the uploads are failing, it is likely that a low number of contributed resources
is due to something in the system discouraging users from uploading resources.
