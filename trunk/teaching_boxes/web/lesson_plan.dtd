<!-- DTD for a lesson plan.
     FIXME - It would be nice to have something a little more complex for things
             like materials and prerequisites to identify individual componenets
	     (e.g. each item in a list of materials). But I don't think we can
	     enforce that kind of structure in the webpage very easily...
