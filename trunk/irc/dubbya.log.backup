<egil> the cartoon on the Al jaseerah site on the North Korean nuclear arms programme (which may well be able to reach the USA but certainly CAN hit US troops) being ignored while Saddam, wh has no nuclear arms is a "menace" are quite amusing 
<Digital_H> miguk the last thing he did was kick out inspectors, what 3 years aog.  he has made no aggressions since the gulf war ended.  
<Miguk> cries of no war for oil are ignorant
<cawt`> CapeGuy so the global terrorists will hate us. nothing will change
--- Starting response with 'change'

<dubbya> change and omani nationals remain unaccounted for women, and right now in a few minutes to expect it could be killed, along with the size of this threat and again 
<cawt`> Miguk yeah, it is
<belmont^> CapeGuy: But I disagree that we are breeding any terrorists at all...if terrorists choose to create themselves because they are upset that we want freedom and liberty....they are to blame for their own development
--- Starting response with 'development'

<dubbya> development program, had likely range of any fingerprints

<CapeGuy> cawt:  Not just ten times as many globally, but those previously on the fence and living in the US of A!
<belmont^> Digital_H: if he didnt care about the iraqi people, we would just drop a nuclear weapon and end this war today
--- Starting response with 'today'
--- Responding: 'today and monitoring the congress more than a gift to keep these sites and can coexist peacefully will be confident they can meet the people '
<dubbya> today and monitoring the congress more than a gift to keep these sites and can coexist peacefully will be confident they can meet the people 
<Miguk> freedom for the iraqi people is and should be secondary to the security of the US, but that is not to say we canna have both
--- Starting response with 'both'
--- Responding: 'both our nation in a huge country and produces chemical agents like it brings, and patients back a child credit to death sentence, many nations, even exist '
<dubbya> both our nation in a huge country and produces chemical agents like it brings, and patients back a child credit to death sentence, many nations, even exist 
<Digital_H> bullshit.  that would not be a smart political movew
<belmont^> CapeGuy: that is not our doing...we dont make them make their choices
<cawt`> CapeGuy; For the past 4 decades these global terrorists have been killing us around the world. It's now known (and verified) that doing nothing makes the problem of global terrorism worse. as evidenced by 9-11
--- Starting response with '9-11'

<dubbya> if this kind of czechoslovakia. they were in his own country

<CapeGuy> Bel:  What happens is you kill an innocent opposed to Sadman ... his/her relatives become instant enemies.
<Digital_H> they have been able to prove no link
<cawt`> CapeGuy Have you ever spoken to arab nationals living in the u.s. they've long told us that they will one day rise up amongst us and kill us. they hate us. surely you know that.
<egil> miguk i think it was Tiberius who said "let them hate me as long as they fear me"                     Caligula said "i wish they all had but one neck; i would hack it through"
<Miguk> thanks egil
<Miguk> one neck is goo
<Digital_H> cawt have you?
<Miguk> good
<belmont^> CapeGuy: so how come all of these Iraqi people who have had their family members tortured and slain at the hands of Saddam Hussein are not terrorists because of him? No one is speaking about that? and why are they not terrorizing him? it doesnt wash
--- Starting response with 'wash'
--- Responding: 'miguk no more ways that iraq '
<dubbya> miguk no more ways that iraq 
<Digital_H> you know lots of arab nationals cawt?
<cawt`> Digital_H they're in Iraq. Iraq has harbored them for decades. well-known truth. one known leader died in Baghdad not too many months ago; who's been plaguing (and killing) Israelis and Americans globally for about the past 40 yrs. lol

<dubbya> lol no later than some have i urge you for it is to confront these threats on the truth though 
<Digital_H> cawt, that
<Digital_H> that's b.s.
<CapeGuy> cawt:  I hate to tell you this, for I truly sympathise, but there was grim pleasure around the Western world on 9/11 (these countries in the USA's front line for yonks) to see the USA itself get "hit directly for once".  Sad, but true.  More coming, for the Atlantic moat doesn't work anymore.
<cawt`> Digital_H you want numbers? LOl  sure. I know arab nationals. haven't done a head-count lately, though. you'll forgive me that I pray
<belmont^> www.usafreedomcorps.gov :)

<dubbya> time when you to choose their society, and comprehensive plan that iraq's dictator accepted a scattered network of iraq and the risk is up in 1990, after iraq's weapons of al qaeda 
<Miguk> i think, in the long run, that it doesn't matter if al qaeda is linked to Iraq, terrorists are terrorists and should be hunted and killed wherever we find them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them make blackmail a high horse and coalition partners are beginning to confront will find freedom for the world community of every member of the obligations as 500 tons of liters of diplomacy '
<dubbya> them make blackmail a high horse and coalition partners are beginning to confront will find freedom for the world community of every member of the obligations as 500 tons of liters of diplomacy 
<cawt`> CapeGuy oh sure. They've been killing us globally for decades. I'm sure you've noticed as I have
<CapeGuy> cawt:  And there are many, many living and working in the USA itself whose allegiances will shift.
<belmont^> Miguk: well said my friend!!!
<Digital_H> the best they could come up with was that there were some training gorunds in northern iraq, out of saddams control, out fo sadaams control
--- Starting response with 'control'
--- Responding: 'control of naval and we will and principles, come to eliminate the united states '
<dubbya> control of naval and we will and principles, come to eliminate the united states 
<cawt`> CapeGuy I expected attacks on U.S. soil for many decades. how could anyone not? when viewing their hatred for us globally for the past FORTY years. alas!
<Miguk> well, 70 cruise missiles on terrorist camps in n. iraq canna be completely wrong, now can they
--- Starting response with 'they'
--- Responding: 'they can alter the regime's repression of our allies will not this promise, spending discipline in the emergency plan is reliant upon big foreign nationals cawt? '
<dubbya> they can alter the regime's repression of our allies will not this promise, spending discipline in the emergency plan is reliant upon big foreign nationals cawt?

<dubbya> Miguk: we work of innocent lives of promise

<cawt`> CapeGuy even some American Citizens will side with the terrorists, as is well-evidenced. no news there
--- Starting response with 'there'

<dubbya> there needs more than a new openness and unconditionally forswear, disclose, and destroyed by iraqi regime wishes peace, and protect infants at all his country

<cawt`> CapeGuy very true. everything changes. 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: oh and Disney was not greedy? John Wayne wasnt an arrogant cowboy? It is called convenient memory, my friend :)
<Miguk> be back later, love the conversation
<CapeGuy> "If sentences don't make sense, don't comment on commas ..."
<cawt`> CapeGuy aw they've thought that of us for a long time. look at what Germany did. and Japan. not 60 yrs ago. already.
<Digital_H> cawt and miguk, your idea of security is to give up freedom.  that's fucked up.   you just buy what your fed hook line and sinker. 
<CapeGuy> Bel:  Look, Wayne would rather slug it out than put a slug in you, and that was before Road Runner!
<byLL> TEHRAN (AFP) - An uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime is under way in the southern city of Basra, the main Shiite Iraqi opposition group said. "A revolt is taking place in Basra," Mohammad Hadi, spokesman of the Iran-based Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (ASRII), told AFP.

<CapeGuy> Bel:  Also, up till Elvis you could still dance touching a gal!
<egil> ..especially if you WERE a girl?
<cawt`> Digital_H I didn't say anything about any of my ideas concerning freedom. You've left me to assume that you're confusing your own thoughts with mine.
<belmont^> CapeGuy: you think its smart to fight hand to hand when you have an arsenal? I think not...and Elvis fought for this country and would have died for it...so he would have been supporting our troops :)
<egil> cawt there's a lot of that about :)
<cawt`> egil; oh yeah. it's pretty common
<belmont^> whose calling who a girl? lol
<cawt`> egil; in human attempts at communication
<belmont^> cawt`: dont assume "human"....ok? hehe
<cawt`> belmont^ LOL
<belmont^> you know we probably wouldnt argue like such cretins if there were a few more women in here :)
<egil> as Neitzche said, that main problem with human communication is the illusion that it has been achieved
<CapeGuy> Bel:  Elvis would not approve of this war, I feel ... Wayne (though a conservative in real life) had common sense, and would have gone with an extended period.
<cawt`> byLL; Yeah. that's really great. the Iraqi citizens are fighting with the UK against Saddam's brutal regime
--- Starting response with 'regime'

<dubbya> egil: bush and our country much closer to be here with inspectors, what i'm the homeland 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: here is the real point...Elvis was an act, John Wayne's persona was fiction and Walt Disney was not a nice man :)
<cawt`> egi; he's a fine one to spew wisdom. he purported that everything outside his own mind was only an illusion. he was severely depressed. he needed meds. not that I think it would've helped him any. he was just plain nuts!
<byLL> cawt`, the thing is Bazra is a Shia city and Saddam is Sunni.  There is no love between them.  It will be a magnitude more difficult when we get to Baghdad
<egil> cawt to whom are you referring? you've lost me on that one
<egil> ah... Neitzche...
<belmont^> byLL: if the soldiers in Baghdad see what is happening in Bazra...there may be a betetr chance they will turn 
<CapeGuy> They went to the Gulf to defend the Iraqi people from American-led forces, but now some of South Africa's "human shields" have returned home, traumatised by the bombings in Baghdad. "Being a human shield when they're throwing bombs won't help anybody," says one, while another has been advised to seek counselling.  (www.iol.co.za)

<cawt`> byLL; oh perhaps. I know it's Shites in the south.and kurds in the north. hey, did you read in recent months about the U.S., Spain & Uk TRYING to get those factioned groups to even sit down & talk to one another. Oh my. That's gonna be a problem. They all seem to hate each other. they wouldn't even go in the same ROOM with each other. 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: those so-called human shields needed counseling before they went to Baghdad...now they are just SHock and Awe hehe :)
<CapeGuy> Bel:  True, but we've had too many anti-American-interest bombings in ZA ... :)
<cawt`> byll; what I read in the papers is that EACH group wants to rule the new Iraq ALONE. The u.s., brits & spain told them; "oh no. you'll rule together or not at all" that's how it's gonna be. 
--- Starting response with 'be'
--- Responding: 'be subliminable sic or near '
<dubbya> be subliminable sic or near 
<cawt`> byLL; it'll be a mess trying them to sit down to the same table together, much less rule the country of Iraq together.

<dubbya> together or makes the planet in the middle east, has destroyed them to our country, they wouldn't even more, i serve 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: there should be resistence to that bombing :)
<byLL> cawt`, yes we have more problems to deal with in the future
<cawt`> byLL; oh i'm sure the u.s. will be in Iraq for an extended period. like Korea, Japan and Germany. not much doubt in my mind about that whatsoever

<dubbya> unlike the families is mobilizing against you know saddam hussein attacked and fully cooperate fully in sparing innocent civilians from any man 
<belmont^> WHat are you all going to say in a couple of years when Bush is voted out as President and we get a new President and he decides to give money to Iraq so that they can help us fight Iran? LOL
--- Starting response with 'lol'

<belmont^> whohooo :D
<belmont^> Its...Its...Hounds of the BASKERvilles!! :)
<cawt`> belmont^; well. my opinion of that (should it be the case) will depend solely on the myriad of various circumstances at that time.
<belmont^> cawt`: good answer :) you diplomat you!! wait...a diplomat! burn him!!!! ;)
<cawt`> belmont^; a bunch of think-tank guys were talking about Iraq and Iran on 9-15-01. on c-span. very interesting.
--- Starting response with 'interesting'
--- Responding: 'in 1991, the peace, it will soon '
<dubbya> in 1991, the peace, it will soon 
<belmont^> cawt`: that had to be a very dry conversation
<cawt`> belmont^ I'm not a diplomat. not at all. I was being sincere. how can I know what I'll think about something that hasen't happened yet, and may never happen at all? I'd be a darn fool to claim that I would 
<cawt`> belmont^; oh no. It was the opposite of boring or dry. It was VERY interesting indeed. 3 days after 9-11 they were talking about this war we're in right now. "saddam's got to go" they said. Asia is next. a great telescope peep into the future
<cawt`> at the time
<byLL> VATICAN CITY -- The vast antiwar movement in the world shows that a "large part of humanity" has rejected the idea of war as a means of resolving conflicts between nations, Pope John Paul II said in a message released Tuesday.
<byLL> The pope, a staunch opponent of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, sent his message to Roman Catholic military chaplains attending a Vatican-organized course on humanitarian law. He cited the "vast contemporary movement in favor of peace" around the world and said he took "comfort and hope" from the efforts for peace by various religions.

<egil> byll maybe it would be a good idea for the USa to borrow a Grand Slam out of the Imperial War Museum in london.....although they are 1,000lbs heavier than the recent MOAB bomb the US has bee promoting recently as the best game in town
<Basker> ergil -- weren't they developed for use against reinforced submarine pens??
<egil> no
<egil> they were developed for blowing the foundations out from under massive structures... the TallBoy mini-version was used against the submarine pens at St Nazaire
<egil> they went through 50 feet of reinforced concrete with NO trouble
<Basker> egil -- ok.  I was alive at the time but have not remembered all the finer details. :)
<egil> the Grand Slams were too expensive to use freely.... only 41 were used in anger
<Basker> egil -- well, we were angry. :)
<egil> true :)
<belmont^> I think once Saddah and his regime are gone, and the North Korean leadership is gone, we will begin to see fewer terrorist attacks...

<DaDuck> did i hear my name?
<Basker> MrSteve -- Sometimes quality is more satisfying than quantity.  This channel is somewhat sporadic -- for which I, as the only op around, give sincere thanks. :)
<nibbers> well i dont know are you using microsoft agent DaDuck ?
<DaDuck> nope .. but what is MS agent?
<nibbers> if not the chances of hearing your name are greatly reduced 
<nibbers> it reads text to you 
<DaDuck> oh
<nibbers> it can also be used to transfer voice to text 
<DaDuck> my mIRC client software script does signal me with a special sound when my name gets mentioned in any irc window
<Basker> Well, if you think rerading it is bad, wait till you hear it. :))

<nibbers> brb gonna go see what that is all about 
<limejuice> in another 20 years, PETA will most likely object masturbation because it's cruelty to sperm
<byLL> MARCH 25--When The Smoking Gun learned today (via a Drudge Report link) that coalition forces in Iraq had embedded sea life in the drive to oust Saddam Hussein, we wondered how long it would take People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to leap to the defense of mine-sweeping dolphins and sea lions.
--- Starting response with 'lions'
--- Responding: 'we wait, the media creation '
<dubbya> we wait, the media creation 
<byLL> "Our troops deserve the best defense possible, but PETA opposes the use of dolphins, sea lions, or any other marine mammals. The project is cruel and cannot provide a reliable defense or surveillance for our troops. 
<byLL> The Navy claims they are not putting these animals in harm's way, but they've removed these animals from their homes, relocated them to foreign waters in the Persian Gulf, and are forcing them to not only inspect the waters, but to actually swim up to potential terrorists under the water, clamp a cuff on their leg, and deploy a floating marker.

<SonicReducer> yeah... the UN should kick their ass
<ne0n> Haven't you yet recognized that there is nothing called the UN?:) It was an american tool to control the world without war and it had given it up:o)
<ne0n> there is nothing called international law or any of this anymore
<Prophyria> and its good of u to have realized this just now
<Prophyria> this's been going on from like ages ago 
<ne0n> lol...this is something known long ago but the whole world was trying to believe the lie
<ne0n> <Prophyria> Where are you from?
<Prophyria> Jordan
<ne0n> Welcome:) Egypt here
<Prophyria> so same batee`7 for both of us
<ne0n> lol..yes
<byLL> ne0n, actually the French are the ones who are destroying the UN
<ne0n> batee'7 al 7okam al 3arab 
<Prophyria> exactly 
<ne0n> byLL, how?
<Prophyria> but ur guy is hillarious hehe
<byLL> ne0n, by failing to take substantial steps to enforce UN resolutions
<ne0n> like what resolution?
<byLL> 1441
<SonicReducer> they took substantial steps
<SonicReducer> they accepted that iraq diddnt comply with 1441
--- Starting response with '1441'
--- Responding: 'among them on the league of mass death and i have an oppressive regime will work '
<dubbya> among them on the league of mass death and i have an oppressive regime will work 
<ne0n> byLL, do you think Iraq has mass destruction weapons?
--- Starting response with 'weapons'
--- Responding: 'weapons and when appropriate, they deserve the suffering to operate in our time, without fingerprints, he calls his hidden materials could be able to suspend hostilities, to live and practices terror and by his own people, have been part of america also strengthen global war against the right now '
<dubbya> weapons and when appropriate, they deserve the suffering to operate in our time, without fingerprints, he calls his hidden materials could be able to suspend hostilities, to live and practices terror and by his own people, have been part of america also strengthen global war against the right now 
<SonicReducer> and they even tabled a resolution in accordence with their interpretation of "serious consequences"
<SonicReducer> what more do you want the french to do?
<byLL> ne0n, I still wonder what they did with the stuff they had in 1998
<ne0n> 1998?
<SonicReducer> what stuff did they have in 1998?
<ne0n> ?!
<SonicReducer> the stuff was just unaccounted for in 1998
<SonicReducer> that doesnt mean they had it
<byLL> No, SonicReducer, the stuff is still unaccounted for.  They had it in 1998.  The question is what has happened to it.
<ne0n> Even if they had, doesn't the US posses the WORLD's Deadliest weapons???
<SonicReducer> unnaccounted for in 1998... still unaccounted for now
<byLL> ne0n, and the USA is getting rid of its WMD
<SonicReducer> the question remains where is it
<byLL> SonicReducer, no, they actually had it in 1998
<Prophyria> and who appointed the Us the right hand of GOd?
<SonicReducer> and their answer is still the same we destroyed it in 1991
<ne0n> LooooooooooooL, this is one of the funniest jokes I ever heard
<ne0n> there is no announced program for the US to get rid of ALL of its WMD
<ne0n> byLL, Where are you?:)
<byLL> ne0n, the USA is getting rid of all of its Chemical and Biological weapon stockpiles.  They are reducing the number of nukes.
<byLL> USA
<Prophyria> that figures
<SonicReducer> byLL: care to give me a url or something (about they had weapons inb 1998)
<Shams_5> <byLL> ne0n, the USA is getting rid of all of its Chemical and Biological weapon stockpiles. <--Oh my, in Israel you mean?
<ne0n> ok, I think USA, UK, France posses the world's deadliest weapons and they are asking others to disarm!!!!!!
<ne0n> there is no logic behind that!!!
<SonicReducer> and china
<ne0n> not to mention Israel!!!!!!!
<SonicReducer> and russia too
<SonicReducer> pakistan and india remember them
<ne0n> i was mentioning the leaders
<Shams_5> China doesn't have its troop in a dozen countries around the world. They still have a better than the yanks, or UK.
<Shams_5> better case
<byLL> Shams_5, it is a fact
<SonicReducer>  agreed
<byLL> better at what?
<ne0n> israel is up to this moment refusing to sign the treaty of limiting WMD and the US as usual (without any common sense) is using the VETO power to protect them!!! I need an explanation!
<SonicReducer> byLL: at respecting the sovreignty of other countries i guess
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, it is a fact<--FACT is that Saddam received most of his arsenal from Western countries, including US back in the 80's.
<byLL> Shams_5, actually that is partially true
<byLL> Shams_5, and Saddam recently still was getting WMD from France, Russia, and Germany
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, actually that is partially true <---So, atleast you admit there is some 'truth'? :)
<SonicReducer> not WMD... that's just conventional weps that he's not allowed
<SonicReducer> that hes getting from europe that it
<SonicReducer> s\
<byLL> ne0n, perhaps it is because Israel is surrounded by hostile nations intend on detroying the "Zinist regime?"  Is that a possibility?
<byLL> Zionist even
<ne0n> even if it isn't true this doesn't give the US the right to launch war against Iraq "in the name of peace"!!!! this is a new terminology in the world of politics: "War in the name of peace"
--- Starting response with 'peace"'
--- Responding: 'iraq "in the important question asked is hearing the last two ways '
<dubbya> iraq "in the important question asked is hearing the last two ways 
<byLL> Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself?
<Shams_5> byLL, Israel is the oppressor, the occupier, the 'hostile'. 
<ne0n> byLL, do u read history?
<byLL> ne0n, it does seem illogical on the surface.
<byLL> Again Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself?
<SonicReducer> no more right than iraq does, byLL
--- Starting response with 'byll'
--- Responding: 'it's not have a growing economy grows worse '
<dubbya> it's not have a growing economy grows worse 
<byLL> SonicReducer, what right is that 
<SonicReducer> to protect itself
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself? <--It has NO right to oppress and butcher the people of Palestine, in order to become a strategic point for US domination and imperialism. 
<ne0n> Israel has always been the hostile party in the war my friend 1956, 1967, 1982!!!! not to mention the palestinians all the time
<SonicReducer> and since iraq is a sovreign nation wheras israel is just an occupation... then it has less right to?
--- Starting response with 'to'
--- Responding: 'to constitute maximum peril from developing those words '
<dubbya> to constitute maximum peril from developing those words 
<byLL> I don't see Israel involved in WMD proliferation
<byLL> ne0n, and no one is hostile to Israel?  CorrecT?
<ne0n> tell me who if u can byLL please
<Shams_5> <byLL> I don't see Israel involved in WMD proliferation<---lol, what an argument! THey only have NUKES and weaponry to wipe out the entire region!
<byLL> ne0n, it is the stated goal of many people in the world to destroy Israel.  Are they justified?
<Shams_5> <byLL> ne0n, and no one is hostile to Israel? <---Why shouldn't the oppressed by hostile to the oppressor?
<byLL> Shams_5, and no one is hostile to Israel?  CorrecT?
<byLL> Shams_5, so you think that Israel has no right to defend itself?
<ne0n> byLL, I'm speaking historical facts. Would you please do too. Don;t just speak about what people intend to do, u can't punish people because U THINK they intend to do
<Shams_5> Israel has not been 'defending' itself, it's been oppressing others, and not following UN resolutions.
<ne0n> plus, Israel's right to exist is a questioned thing
<SonicReducer> byLL: i think israel has no right to defend itself
<G> i have a question

<wilson666> you probably handle my ass pennies every day
<saggasse> indigestion?
<wilson666> how does that make you feel
<wilson666> of course i spend the pennies afterwards
<saggasse> big shit, probably.
<wilson666> yep
<wilson666> but the fact is
<fryDeg> WHY, are they showing familes of the POW's on tv?????
<saggasse> cool.
<rev0lt> Most americans have strong views about how the people of the rest of the world -- especially nonwhite people of nonwesternized nations -- should live their lives.  Yet, most americans have never stepped outside of the U.S. or even their home states, and lack understanding of other cultures and histories.
<wilson666> you probably touch something thats been in my ass almost every day
<saggasse> 'Cause we all watch.
<wilson666> i have the upper hand here
<wilson666> this is how we show the system
<SonicReducer> oh rev0lt shut up
<wilson666> with ass pennies
<SonicReducer> say something new
<saggasse> if you shat your brains, a penny would come out.

<saggasse> call that a cent.
<wilson666> 2 cent
<saggasse> disagreed.
<wilson666> so
<fryDeg> "tell us everything, or our agent in America is going to kill your little sister rachael"
<saggasse> good shitten.
<wilson666> that doesnt change the fact that your hands as been on something thats been in my ass

--- Responding: 'that that iraq electric shock, burning with social security of government program! '
<dubbya> that that iraq electric shock, burning with social security of government program! 
<saggasse> I fail to perceive the meaning...
<fryDeg> Marines confiscated over more than 200 weapons, more than 3,000 chemical suits with masks and Iraqi military uniforms in the hospital, and found a T-55 tank in the hospital compound, U.S. Central Command said. 
--- Starting response with 'said'
--- Responding: 'said in every way to human rights and capable nuclear materials '
<dubbya> said in every way to human rights and capable nuclear materials 
<saggasse> what's the panic. This is war. The 2nd WW lasted for years. What makes you think this will be different?
<wilson666> its different because my ass pennies are circulating around
<belmont^> saggasse: its a superpower against a ragtag army thats why
<saggasse> yup.
<saggasse> there's a certain probability p=0,0001
<saggasse> belmont: actually, I agree. 
<wilson666> no man
<wilson666> theres at least 11,000,000 of them out there
<saggasse> I just don't see a biological attack in the form of infected pennies making their rounds.
<wilson666> a little more than that
<wilson666> you just wait
<wilson666> hahaha
<saggasse> belmont: will still be hundreds of dead coalitionists.
<saggasse> belmont: or even thousands.
<SonicReducer> the iraqi army i think is twice that of the invaders

<dubbya> america speaks with mass murder as long captivity of mass murder even when i'm talking about black and stopped terrorist networks are designed to dominate the world now 
<saggasse> 11,000,000 pennies???
<SonicReducer> its just that the coalition had air superiority

<Gabby_Hayes> and the movie that won all those awards last Sunday, wasn't the first "Chicago" film
<KurtChicago> My Big Fat Greek Wedding... supposed to be Greektown Chicago, but filmed in??? Toronto!
<KurtChicago> well, in any case... the Oscars ceremony was sort of interesting
<Gabby_Hayes> and all of them were based on a true story
<KurtChicago> my candidate was Lords of the Ring/Two Towers
<Rayth> I agree
<KurtChicago> The Hours = boring chick flick
<KurtChicago> The Pianist = overused subject
<KurtChicago> Chicago = Musical! (A good reason to disklike it as a straight man)
<Rayth> that's not why I disslike it
<Rayth> I'v e never seen it

<Rayth> The Chinese can stop in mid air
<rev0lt> a jewish pianist survives the holocaust, and the jews actor wins an oscar
<Rayth> sounds jewish
<rev0lt> the jewish carpenter got nailed to the cross, and the world worships him as God after 2000 years
<KurtChicago> well, brody is a good actor and polanski a good director
<Rayth> sounds christian

<Ragna> I love it when they show some 6th grader protesting the war...
<Dark_W0lf> heh...
<CultureWar> most of the very small amount of protesters in Pittsburgh that were out (past tense) were the usual leftist wackos.  Nobody real was out protesting.
<Ragna> "and like war is like, bad and stuff. and like it's just wrong to go there like for whatever bush wants..."
--- Starting response with 'wants"'
--- Responding: 'like a former chief weapons '
<dubbya> like a former chief weapons 
<CultureWar> And there were plenty of counter-protesters...
<CultureWar> but now nobody is out..
<WDubya3> <back> :-)
<Dark_W0lf> I'm pro war, but really dont want to be
<Dark_W0lf> but this war is needed cause saddam is worse than Bush...
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush pulled the security council president '
<dubbya> bush pulled the security council president 
<CultureWar> I'm not "pro" war... I'm not happy that it is necessary.  But it is necessary, and I'm satisfied that we're doing what has to be done.
<WDubya3> We had about 200 protesting sat.  and maybe 4-5 anti-peace protestors on the shabby side of the street.
<Dark_W0lf> CultureWar: same here
<CultureWar> 200... oooh.... wow... I guess we'd better stop the war.
<Ragna> heh, anti-peace.
<Dark_W0lf> I'd be one of the shabby guys at this protest...
<WDubya3> That 200 is up from maybe 50 some 3 weeks ago.  
<Ragna> you think the opposite of war is peace, WDubya3?
<WDubya3> We are a smaller city in Calif.
<CultureWar> so you're saying it was really an insignificant protest then?
<Dark_W0lf> <sarcasm>wow</sarcasm>
<WDubya3> Ragna In this arena?  yup!
<Ragna> in this arena?
<CultureWar> over 70% of people in the US are supporting this action in Iraq... 200 people protesting don't even register for me...
--- Starting response with 'me'
--- Responding: 'me on terror against smallpox, and biological weapons of peace of the important job is like, bad path '
<dubbya> me on terror against smallpox, and biological weapons of peace of the important job is like, bad path 
<Dark_W0lf> they mean in california
<Ragna> so in other arenas, it would not be?
<WDubya3> yea, in this conflict?  sure!
<WDubya3> C'mon Ragna , you heard what Bush said. You are either for or against.  right?  
--- Starting response with 'right'
--- Responding: 'right thing is clear our purpose is not helping to the south depends on integrity in a policy of theirs can meet the first chapter of the people of men free nations would be unavoidable '
<dubbya> right thing is clear our purpose is not helping to the south depends on integrity in a policy of theirs can meet the first chapter of the people of men free nations would be unavoidable 
<WDubya3> heh!
<Ragna> and how do you interpret that?
<Dark_W0lf> in this conflict the opponent has chem, and bio weapons... and is insane...
<Ragna> if countries aren't for our fight on terrorism, they're for terrorists?
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists such as a new openness and kill thousands '
<dubbya> terrorists such as a new openness and kill thousands 
<WDubya3> Ragna What does Iraq have to do with terrorism?
--- Starting response with 'terrorism'
--- Responding: 'terrorism itself, it's clearly violates the middle class, i smile. i don't see it is the oppression of war is a vital to congress will make our nation needs to seek and clarity and production and troops, and designs of the united nations' inspections '
<dubbya> terrorism itself, it's clearly violates the middle class, i smile. i don't see it is the oppression of war is a vital to congress will make our nation needs to seek and clarity and production and troops, and designs of the united nations' inspections 
<CultureWar> They train and support terrorists
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists are they fully within many many? '
<dubbya> terrorists are they fully within many many? 
<Ragna> well, colin powell mentioned terrorist ties in his report to the UN council.
--- Starting response with 'council'
--- Responding: 'council have another boring, melodramatic movie that saddam hussein has gassed many iraqis surrendered to vote on the jews are beginning to hell are going on... '
<dubbya> council have another boring, melodramatic movie that saddam hussein has gassed many iraqis surrendered to vote on the jews are beginning to hell are going on... 
<WDubya3> heh! ok CuFFaway , How many of the 9/11 terrorists came from Iraq?
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq has held accountable '
<dubbya> iraq has held accountable 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: there has only BEEN one...
<CultureWar> They have a terrorist training camp at Salmon Pak (spelling?) where they have a Boeing that they use to practice taking over airplanes with
--- Starting response with 'with'
--- Responding: 'with social security in one coffee ? '
<dubbya> with social security in one coffee ? 
<WDubya3> Sheesh!  Must we revisit old news every time...
<Ragna> you seem to be confusing nationality with state sanction, WDubya3.
<CultureWar> Al Qaeda members have been in Iraq for such training
--- Starting response with 'training'
--- Responding: 'training camps in which places like this. they must not following orders such training camp at the state '
<dubbya> training camps in which places like this. they must not following orders such training camp at the state 
<Ragna> old news isn't false news.
<WDubya3> nah, Iraqis don't even like Al-Qaeda.  They oppose each other ideologies.
--- Starting response with 'ideologies'
--- Responding: 'well, the united states will set foot in the world war has learned that doesnt change of people are tortured '
<dubbya> well, the united states will set foot in the world war has learned that doesnt change of people are tortured 
<CultureWar> that didn't stop Iraq from training them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them hes going next decade to teach a smirk or juice if iraq's weapons & kill wildlife, and germany doesn't want the gulf war on tv????? '
<dubbya> them hes going next decade to teach a smirk or juice if iraq's weapons & kill wildlife, and germany doesn't want the gulf war on tv????? 
<Dark_W0lf> on another, funnier note, how about these human shields?
<Ragna> yet they're united in their hatred for the US. and by iraqis, I hope you mean the iraqi govt.
--- Starting response with 'govt'
--- Responding: 'govt to invest and it reaches people of the iraq complies w/ nuclear program was working with the worlds resources and stealing '
<dubbya> govt to invest and it reaches people of the iraq complies w/ nuclear program was working with the worlds resources and stealing 
<Dark_W0lf> how effective would these wingnuts be?
<Dark_W0lf> not at all
<Ragna> heh, have you read some of their revelatory stories, Dark_W0lf?
<WDubya3> CultureWar There are more Al-Qaeda in the US then there was in Iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq is exploring ways of weapons of the most important question you had air '
<dubbya> iraq is exploring ways of weapons of the most important question you had air 
<Ragna> how they've come back to the US realizing the error in their judgements and hoping that saddam is overthrown?
<Ragna> WDubya3> and you know this how?
<Dark_W0lf> oh cool...
<WDubya3> Ragna I read.  I'm literate.
<Ragna> plus, iraq isn't al-queda's target, the US and its allies are.
--- Starting response with 'are'
--- Responding: 'are incredibly stupid to launch war in toronto. '
<dubbya> are incredibly stupid to launch war in toronto. 
<CultureWar> WDubya3, they are here illegally... they were invited guests to Iraq to receive terrorist training
--- Starting response with 'training'
--- Responding: 'training camps in baton rouge, louisiana '
<dubbya> training camps in baton rouge, louisiana 
<Dark_W0lf> but even if they DID go to Iraq, they wouldnt be able to be identified via dental records if they wee shot by a .50 calibre...
--- Starting response with 'calibre'
--- Responding: 'pakistan and lifts up '
<dubbya> pakistan and lifts up 
<Dark_W0lf> *were
<Ragna> WDubya3> well I sure would like to know how there sources know numbers of al-queda operatives here. Or are they just assuming?
<WDubya3> CultureWar You're misinformed imo.  Saddam himself said they had and will have nothing to do with them.  They are not wanted there.  They do not agree on anything.  How much more plain can I make it to you?
<CultureWar> yeah, like I believe Saddam... he's a real trustworthy source...
<Ragna> lol
<CultureWar> He also said they had no more scuds or other missiles...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: do you believe EVERYTHING you hear from Saddam?
<Ragna> yeah really. if saddam said it, it must be truE!
<CultureWar> well what have they been firing into Kuwait the last week
<Dark_W0lf> heh exactly
<Ragna> like how they don't have the scud missiles that they fired into kuwait a few days ago.
<Dark_W0lf> no scuds... RIIIIGHT....
<Ragna> and no chemical weapons! :)
<WDubya3> Read and study what each sect believes and practices. Then maybe we can talk and you will have "some" understanding.
<Dark_W0lf> <sarrasm>No these arent scuds! Their Sducs! (scud spelled backwards)</sarcasm>
<CultureWar> what they believe is irrelevant...\
<Ragna> so if saddam is such a vigorously religious muslim, and adheres to its beliefs and practices... why the genocide?
<CultureWar> the US and UK didn't like Stalin... and Stalin didn't like the US and UK... but they helped each other in WWII...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: dont think you are an expert here...
<CultureWar> likewise Al 
<WDubya3> Iraq did not help do 9/11 and no terrorist from Iraq ever did terror in the US.  
--- Starting response with 'us'
--- Responding: 'us to a good start showing up the persian gulf, who planned the 21st century '
<dubbya> us to a good start showing up the persian gulf, who planned the 21st century 
<Fire_on_High> would any of you guys be willing to check a pic for me and see if it loads?
<CultureWar> likewise Al-Qaeda doesn't like Iraq... but that won't stop them from utilizing Iraqi terrorist training camps
--- Starting response with 'camps'
--- Responding: 'camps in ourselves alone because i worked within his own military and the region '
<dubbya> camps in ourselves alone because i worked within his own military and the region 
<Ragna> your latter may very well be true, but you have no way of verifying the previous one.
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf I kinda stopped talking to you because of your insults. 
<WDubya3> oh well...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: I insulted you ONCE...
<Dark_W0lf> ever heard of sledging?
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf I learn quick!  Sometimes once is enough. :-)
<gabbo5555> How is the killing going?
<Dark_W0lf> well from what I've seen, you havent learned much...
<WDubya3> Hi gabbo5555 :-)
<gabbo5555> Hi
<CultureWar> gabbo, we'll know as soon as Baghdad falls
<CultureWar> Well, I'm off to elsewhere...
<CultureWar> on to Baghdad
<CuFFaway> saddam has wired all of his bridges with explosives
<Ragna> yeah he'd do that.
<CuFFaway> mmhmm
<Dark_W0lf> too bad HE didnt do it...
<WDubya3> CuFFaway Smart!  :-) 
<Dark_W0lf> his troops did...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: yes...
<CuFFaway> un der his order
<gabbo5555> Is there any American who believes the excuses of the US government for this war?
<Dark_W0lf> a smart thing to do
<CuFFaway> a despewrate thing to do
<CuFFaway> -w
<Ragna> is there a war, gabbo5555?
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 There are some here who claim they do.  Don't look at me.  I see right through Bush's lies.
--- Starting response with 'lies'
--- Responding: 'in one american families is not only has a severe and uk... but not evil, then not on the security council resolution setting obstacles against terror '
<dubbya> in one american families is not only has a severe and uk... but not evil, then not on the security council resolution setting obstacles against terror 
<Dark_W0lf> and I see right through your ignorance of other's comments, WDubya3...
<gabbo5555> Ragna, ask the iraquis... they're the ones being attacked, they'll know better. Americans at their homes dont know what a war is
--- Starting response with 'is'
--- Responding: 'is from place more worried about me a year which they did a totalitarian state sanction, wdubya3. and documentation of cynicism and when you know, the help the reason we are winning '
<dubbya> is from place more worried about me a year which they did a totalitarian state sanction, wdubya3. and documentation of cynicism and when you know, the help the reason we are winning 
<CuFFaway> we learned on 9-11
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf All you do is insult. You can't win any debate or argument that way.  heh!  Try bringing some "facts" to the dialog.
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: think world war II...
<Ragna> omfg wats an iraqi lolololr?!?!11
--- Starting response with 'lolololr11'
--- Responding: 'and weaken our own '
<dubbya> and weaken our own 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: i've only been insulting YOU, because you leave yourself wide open to ANYBODY sledging you....
<WDubya3> The only fear is fear itself.  
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf Well I'm doing fine, How about you?  :-) 
<Ragna> odd how you quote someone who stood up for his ideals despite the economic and civilian costs.
<Dark_W0lf> about what?
<WDubya3> Kinda like me! :-) 
<Ragna> and bush
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush or will veto power '
<dubbya> bush or will veto power 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: you just havent noticed the others insulting you... I'm just good at intimidating people apparenlty
<Ragna> so you and bush are really alike, WDubya3! :)
--- Starting response with ':)'
--- Responding: 'the ambitions and under the job is another threat, from enablers to others, and greatest fear itself. '
<dubbya> the ambitions and under the job is another threat, from enablers to others, and greatest fear itself. 
<WDubya3> Ragna Not at all.  I never went AWOL and was never caught DUI.  :-)  Other then that well I am a male.  That is the extent of the similarities.
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: and that means WHAT to me?
<Ragna> but you just said you stand up for your ideals despite economic and civilians costs.
<Ragna> so obviously it goes past just sexual similarity.
<WDubya3> Ragna No, I never said that , you did.  :-)  
<Dark_W0lf> a person could be i a mental institute, and yet if they got elected, could STILL run a country...
<Dark_W0lf> *in
<Ragna> what was the "kinda like me! :-)" directed to?
<WDubya3> Ragna I do stand up for my ideals though. One of them is not attacking others who have not attacked me. :-)  That is easy to stand against even if alone. 
<WDubya3> imo.
<WDubya3> The attackers always leave. Perhaps low morale.  :-)
<Dark_W0lf> not always...
<CuFFaway> i spose waiting until he launches a biological attack is one option, well other than the fact that youd be dead
<Dark_W0lf> sometimes the attackers stay for the view...
<Dark_W0lf> CuFFaway: right on...
<Dark_W0lf> I'd rather minimise a threat, rather than try and deal with the threat later...
<WDubya3> CuFFaway That is just fear talking.  Any one of some 100 nations could do that.  
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: true, but only ONE country has Treatened it...
<Dark_W0lf> *threatened
<WDubya3> um.. N. Korea?
<CuFFaway> any one of a hundred nations havent had saddam hussein controlling their every breath for 34 long yrs
<gabbo5555> Eisenhower once said that "preventive attacks" were invented by Hitler
<Dark_W0lf> ok stand corrected... N. Korea also
<Dark_W0lf> but that's only 2 in 100...
<WDubya3> um... USSR during the missle crisis?
<CuFFaway> walking around with your head up your ass all the time must be boring
<WDubya3> Um... Cuba?
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: that's not NOW is it?
<CuFFaway> brb coffee
<WDubya3> um... China even at one time? 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: that is the past
<WDubya3> all alone...
<WDubya3> :-) 
<Dark_W0lf> right now, TWO countries are ...
<WDubya3> brb
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: are you forgetting the allied forces of WWII? 
<Dark_W0lf> They're still around...
<Dark_W0lf> some have given up, and others have raised their hands in taking out saddam...
<Dark_W0lf> fear has an new meaning now, and it's called Chemical and Biological weapons of mass destruction...
<WordProcessor> o_O
<WordProcessor> UMM
<WDubya3> back :-)
<gabbo5555> 1984
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf Go back to insults.  You were better there. :-)
<CuFFaway> would you wait until a guy with a baseball bat swung it at your wifes head before reacting? afterall, just because he has it raised above his head is no proof he will actually use it
<Dark_W0lf> but the threat is there...
<gabbo5555> lol cuFFaway
<gabbo5555> you're nuts
<Dark_W0lf> no he's got a point there...
<CuFFaway> im notta he and namecalling is not a very effective way to communicate
<WDubya3> Hi WP
<Dark_W0lf> CuFFaway: you directing that namecalling at me? or some other?
<CuFFaway> gabbo
<Dark_W0lf> oh
<Dark_W0lf> ok just off the subject here, who thinks I'm annoying?
<WDubya3> CuFFaway Would you use a nuke on the guy?
<CuFFaway> i dont
<WDubya3> heh!
<CuFFaway> only if I had to
<WDubya3> :-)
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: we havent actually USED a nuke yet...
<gabbo5555> Weapons of mass destruction are nothing new. Countries have had them for many years. China, Russia, Pakistan, India... Why dont you attack them? Those regimes are even worse than Iraq's regime. Better hit them first
--- Starting response with 'first'
--- Responding: 'first time debating it '
<dubbya> first time debating it 
<Dark_W0lf> well not that I know of..
<CuFFaway> no excuse
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: Saddam is from Iraq, and is THREATENING the WORLD...
--- Starting response with 'world'
--- Responding: 'world must leave iraq w/ un der his nuclear weapon '
<dubbya> world must leave iraq w/ un der his nuclear weapon 
<Dark_W0lf> the other's ARENT...
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 Of course they have.  Many nations have Gas, and all kinds of stuff. 
<gabbo5555> lol
<CuFFaway> if you dont stand up to terrorists they will take your life
--- Starting response with 'life'
--- Responding: 'life is not say that a nuclear program weapons of our commitment by failing to others, even at iran is going out friendship, ambition, moral cause, and capable of those weapons, even their faces an enemy '
<dubbya> life is not say that a nuclear program weapons of our commitment by failing to others, even at iran is going out friendship, ambition, moral cause, and capable of those weapons, even their faces an enemy 
<gabbo5555> You're the most brainwashed suckers I have seen in my life
<CuFFaway> hah
<CuFFaway> you have any mirrors in your house?
<gabbo5555> you will swallow everything your government says. Are you 10 years old?
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: I HATE the government
<Dark_W0lf> but if there WAS no government, who's to say we would be better off?
<gabbo5555> now, that makes sense. Americans hate government but when it comes to attack some third world ass they love government
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 They only know the Bush line.  You see they fear, not unlike Bush.   They need to believe the US can have freedom and do whatever it wants without any responcibility for it and w/o any dialog between nations.
--- Starting response with 'nations'
--- Responding: 'nations was liberated... at risk we are afraid of the us on prescription drugs '
<dubbya> nations was liberated... at risk we are afraid of the us on prescription drugs 
<CuFFaway> all i can say is thank fuckin gawd gore isnt president or we'd be constantly recounting scuds
<CuFFaway> the terrorists wanted our attention and now they have it... whine whine whine

<WDubya3> Trickle down, or supply side, or voodoo economics does not work in any long term.  It concentrates the wealth and takes the middle classes down.  And Bush's tax cut for the rich is the same deal.  You need to get the money to the people who will spend it and invest it the fastest. That is not the rich.  That is the middle class.  That is what jumpstarts an economy.
--- Starting response with 'economy'
--- Responding: 'economy out with life on the us. '
<dubbya> economy out with life on the us. 
<asilisa> the rich pay taxes too
<WDubya3> $100 will not help me.  Bha!
<asilisa> you want a free ride on the back of rich ppl
<asilisa> typical
<WDubya3> I am not poor. I am upper-middle class.
<asilisa> punish the rich
<WDubya3> I don't envy the rich. 
<WDubya3> I also don't bark about my taxes and I pay a lot of them.
<asilisa> i dont think the rich bark either and they pay more
<Karlos^> yeah
<Karlos^> after all it's our responsibilities 
<asilisa> why dont sum of those rich ass celebrities who have 5 mansions chip in
<Karlos^> just do it 
<WDubya3> They don't pay what they should and they don't deserve a huge tax refund disproportionant to the middle and poor.  
<asilisa> i dont think they got anything disproportionate
<asilisa> thats what you would like
<WDubya3> And if you call this a stimulus package you wont stimulate the economy by giving the rich money. 
<asilisa> u pay more you get back more
<Karlos^> well the rich stimulates the economy by spending a lot 
<Karlos^> isnt it 
<WDubya3> Stimulus happens best and biggest in the middle of the road worker. The middle class.
<asilisa> so you want to punish the rich
<WDubya3> The rich do not spend the money.
<asilisa> for being rich
<asilisa> your logic is not sound
<asilisa> brb
<WDubya3> They will throw it in gold or savings durring a bad economy.  Where do you get this stuff?
<WDubya3> To stimulate an economy the money has to be moving through the economy, not sitting in a swiss bank.
<asilisa> its their money.. would u like to tell them how to spend it?
<WDubya3> It's the Govt's money. 
<asilisa> bullshit
<WDubya3> And yes!  I want the Govt to spend stimulus money on stimulus.
<asilisa> you want a free ride on the back of ppl who worked to be rich
<WDubya3> not padding the bank account of the wealthy.  How will that help any economy?
<asilisa> you want to reap the rewards of their success
<WDubya3> It's a economic stimulus pakage. That what it is for.  Hello?
<WDubya3> I'm already a success.

<asilisa> thats why 911 happened
<asilisa> its just like the animal kingdom.. the injured animal is the one that gets eaten by its peers
<Quickshot> I don't understand the terrorist point.  Next to the WTC, I've yet to see another major attack.  It's not like it's very common.
--- Starting response with 'common'
--- Responding: 'common security of his regime has conquered a matter of a terrible threats were receiving the peace, it is dressing his bowels out. i don't see large number of international law btw. '
<dubbya> common security of his regime has conquered a matter of a terrible threats were receiving the peace, it is dressing his bowels out. i don't see large number of international law btw. 
<asilisa> many many attacks have been averted
<asilisa> did you think we shud sit there and wait for the next attack?
<WDubya3> Quickshot 3000 odd people and a 4 billion dollar building, not to mention the billions in homeland crap and the pentagon.  I'd say they can rest a while.
<Quickshot> hmmm, I figure the US wouldn't get attacked if it was more careful in it's political statements.
<asilisa> hah
<asilisa> care to elaborate?
<WDubya3> How long does it take for Israel to lose 3000 people to terror?
--- Starting response with 'terror'
--- Responding: 'terror is going to buy highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for murder '
<dubbya> terror is going to buy highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for murder 
<WDubya3> years?
<asilisa> it wont happen because israel responds... they are not weak they are small
<Quickshot> hmm, well to put it in another terms, next to internal terrorist activities. I've yet to hear most other major nations having much trouble over terrorism. Why?  I figure because most don't actively meddle so much with other nations interests.
--- Starting response with 'interests'
--- Responding: 'interests and kuwait and defining moment '
<dubbya> interests and kuwait and defining moment 
<asilisa> you must not watch the news much
<Quickshot> was that last comment to me?
<asilisa> mmhmm
<WDubya3> yea Quickshot , I mean all the hate focus is on the US.  They are busy planning dirty tricks for us. 
<asilisa> the us doesnt hide behind the skirts of women and beds of sick ppl
<Quickshot> well that's just a guess of yours. I've not seen much evidence for it in real actions being under taken against the US.
<asilisa> saddams the tricky one
<Quickshot> and that's true, the US is agressive in it's political statements. But you reap what you sow ofcourse.
<WDubya3> asilisa needs to get a world view some year. heh!
<asilisa> the world view is 47 nations in the coalition supporting the effort
<WDubya3> yea Quickshot , That's true
<asilisa> yeah how dare we complain outloud when the world trade center came down.. what were we thinking
<WDubya3> complain = war.  heh!
<WDubya3> understated a bit. 
<asilisa> war = saddams refusal to abide by 1440
<asilisa> the world said disarm
<asilisa> he didnt
<Quickshot> umm, that's not a true argument, the WTC got attacked because of agressive political stances over matters concerning muslim nations.
<asilisa> bullshit
<Quickshot> ofcourse this isn't an excuse for them to attack either, anyone silly enough to do that should suffer the consequences as well.
<asilisa> the wtc got attacked because terrorists are cowards
--- Starting response with 'cowards'
--- Responding: 'i was then claim the facts lead a world '
<dubbya> i was then claim the facts lead a world 
<WDubya3> Quickshot yup! The very same reason we had 9/11 is being created again by this war.  So we all know who to thank.  Thank you Mr. idiot and the Cons.
<asilisa> why didnt they attack the forces already in their region? instead they blew up civilians.. many civilians who got up, went to work and died 
<asilisa> cowards
<Quickshot> oh that could be true I guess.  It is pretty cowardly to go after civilian targets.
<asilisa> thats exactly what the terrorists want you to feel.. fear of reprisal
--- Starting response with 'reprisal'
--- Responding: 'yes...they could detract from the homeland security, and by aljazeera feed '
<dubbya> yes...they could detract from the homeland security, and by aljazeera feed 
<asilisa> fear is how saddam has remained in power.. he knows how to dish it out, lets see if he can take it
<Quickshot> I'm sure he can actually.
<WDubya3> I fear nothing.  And I have patience.  I don't fear what Bush has a knee jerk reaction to.  Yet Saddam is such a threat that in these 12 years w/o inspections Saddam did what? Oh yea, nothing...
--- Starting response with 'nothing'
--- Responding: 'nothing can get more plain can know how much power of the resolve is clear our commitment to cease persecution of every life and allies at this promise, spending discipline in a just months for. they will accept that ... '
<dubbya> nothing can get more plain can know how much power of the resolve is clear our commitment to cease persecution of every life and allies at this promise, spending discipline in a just months for. they will accept that ... 
<Quickshot> you don't stay dictator for so long without being able to stand fear.
<WDubya3> Hey Basker 
<asilisa> yeah saddam can take it.. can his ppl take it?
<Basker> Morning all :))
<Quickshot> well I've always wondered if saddam might have financed 9/11
<asilisa> thats the difference between leadership and tyranny
<asilisa> morning basker
<WDubya3> Quickshot I wonder if Bush did.
--- Starting response with 'did'
--- Responding: 'did they gave saddam hussein's actions killed or any signs of our nation finds hope, where wings take '
<dubbya> did they gave saddam hussein's actions killed or any signs of our nation finds hope, where wings take 
<WDubya3> heh!
<PhatEmu> Byrd quoted from a letter of then-Representative Abraham Lincoln, who warned: "Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion... and you allow him to make war at pleasure. The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, prete
<asilisa> theres a ridiculous statement
<asilisa> ...<WDubya3> Quickshot I wonder if Bush did.
--- Starting response with 'did'
--- Responding: 'did nothing to achieve it? '
<dubbya> did nothing to achieve it? 
<Quickshot> indeed.
<WDubya3> Oh , but 9/11 has been so darn good for Bush. 
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush is crucial step the ages ago '
<dubbya> bush is crucial step the ages ago 
<asilisa> throw in another tangent when you fear seeing reason.. run away and hide from it
<WDubya3> W/o 9/11 Bush might have to focus on domestic policy.
--- Starting response with 'policy'
--- Responding: 'policy of the highways on integrity in the use of history anymore? '
<dubbya> policy of the highways on integrity in the use of history anymore? 
<Quickshot> WDubya3: Your argument is flawed, because if you got caught it would be the end of you.  To high a risk.
<asilisa> what for? we would be too busy watching americans die in terrorists attacks to reap the rewards of his hard work
--- Starting response with 'work'
--- Responding: 'work and al qaeda leader torture and biological weapons, saddam hussein had an urgent duty falls to a dangerous weapons '
<dubbya> work and al qaeda leader torture and biological weapons, saddam hussein had an urgent duty falls to a dangerous weapons 
<WDubya3> Quickshot If you have that kind of power an influence would your chance of getting caught be high or low?
<Quickshot> WDubya3: Very high, because more people watch your actions.
<asilisa> exactly
<WDubya3> heh!  Quickshot Have you ever heard of a proxy?
<WDubya3> People get paid to do nasty stuff every day.
<Quickshot> so what.
<Quickshot> it's not like the US is the only nation to do the watching at bush.
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush or a world of deceit and i think we don't realize how dare we are you?:) '
<dubbya> bush or a world of deceit and i think we don't realize how dare we are you?:) 
<PhatEmu> coalition will be gassed - coalition will respond with small nuke
<WDubya3> Even the CIA do nasty illegal stuff abroad and here at home.
<WDubya3> There was an old joke.  You workd for the CIA? You want to die?  heh!
<asilisa> unno what i think is gonna do saddam in? that ridiculous speech he made calling his ppl to arms.. he must think they dont have eyes or brains.. they see what he does and has been doing for 34 yrs yet blatantly pretends he's innocent to the very ppl he has starved
<asilisa> i think that prolly pissed a few of them off
<Quickshot> maybe, maybe not. It's hard to fathom irak's people ideas.
<asilisa> inno thats because they are so suppressed.. if you grew up living like that its all you would know, but they know pain and they know suffering
<asilisa> and when they cant provide their families with the basic essentials of life its an eye opener.. theyre crazed with thirst and hunger
<Quickshot> that's an assumption. I got the impression irak's people wern't that bad off.
<asilisa> and i think they will rise
<PhatEmu> can the americans live with nuking baghdad?
<WDubya3> Who cares about Saddam?  Anyone here vote for Saddam or against Saddam?  I voted for a US president and that is my duty.  I didn't vote for an idiot like Bush.  Saddams done me or the US little harm.  Bush on the other hand has done great harm to the US. 
--- Starting response with 'us'
--- Responding: 'us was required for the iraqi military importance to realize how do u just playing with this issue doesn't use innocent and the terrorists and we will return stolen property, accept no peace proposal '
<dubbya> us was required for the iraqi military importance to realize how do u just playing with this issue doesn't use innocent and the terrorists and we will return stolen property, accept no peace proposal 
<asilisa> oh ya gores not an idiot
<asilisa> saddam won his election by 100% fear
<asilisa> thats a red flag folks
<Quickshot> hmm, on to other matters. I'm wondering what a more democratic irak would make for a differance in the persian gulf region.
<WDubya3> asilisa When are you going to war? Sounds like china should be next under your thinking.
<WDubya3> heh!
<asilisa> you dont really know my thinking
<WDubya3> sure I do, what little there is. 
<asilisa> nice
<asilisa> resort to insults
<WDubya3> you have been speaking it here for hours.
<Quickshot> sigh, more retoric.
<asilisa> are you now an authority on my thinking?
<asilisa> by what standard?
<WDubya3> heh!
<WDubya3> heh!
<asilisa> okay i guess we are dun for now... see yall later
<WDubya3> Have a better one.
<Quickshot> anyone here have some more solid evidence on matters, like the way saddam mains position?
<Quickshot> see you.
<Quickshot> hm?
<asilisaway> byeeeee
<WDubya3> main position?
<Quickshot> hmmm?
<PhatEmu> america is an occupied nation
<PhatEmu> occupied by a dictatorial regime
<Quickshot> I don't see how you could in any reasonable way define that it is.
<PhatEmu> bush was not elected he was appointed by the supreme court
--- Starting response with 'court'
--- Responding: 'and i want you a goal '
<dubbya> and i want you a goal 
<Quickshot> that's rather non sensical. He still got near to 50% of the votes from the people.
<PhatEmu> bush is in violation of his oth of office and the constitution on several fronts
--- Starting response with 'fronts'
--- Responding: 'during the world has much less developed mobile biological agents like this. we use wmds and the hope that the us, we will soon '
<dubbya> during the world has much less developed mobile biological agents like this. we use wmds and the hope that the us, we will soon 
<Quickshot> and the system doesn't seem to have any unusual errors.
<Quickshot> being inn violation has little to do with getting legally into office though.
<PhatEmu> american people are permitting bush to wage an illegal war without congressional approval by a war powers act
--- Starting response with 'act'
--- Responding: 'act against his holidays in guantamala bay and wait for the peace, and hope against saddam? i would expect of mass destruction '
<dubbya> act against his holidays in guantamala bay and wait for the peace, and hope against saddam? i would expect of mass destruction 
<WDubya3> heh! You wouldn't call a president winning by appointment of a court an error?
<WDubya3> I guess not. 
<PhatEmu> no connection between his brother being the governor of the state that had all the errors huh
<Quickshot> since when have wars become illegal?  
<Quickshot> though I figure no congressional approval is less good.
<PhatEmu> since they are not on the approval of the congress and united nations
<PhatEmu> we are in violation of iternational law and constitutional law - but, that's no biggie right?
<WDubya3> The Supreme court tainted the election. They could have said, "Hey, we refuse to hear this case."  Or they could have said, "Hey you go count the ballots." , but instead they stuck their partisen nose where it never belonged.
<Quickshot> well the UN is a bit weak you know. Though it's best to try and get more formal approvement of such things from the UN.
<PhatEmu> best? no, actually it the duty of american government, they are signatories - bound by a contract
<WDubya3> They made a divided decission on undivided power.
<Quickshot> well the people of the US should make sure that the goverment stys compliant to it's own laws.
<PhatEmu> indeed quickshot, and the american people are mute if not simply ignorant and lazy
<WDubya3> The ballots never mattered after the SC got hold of it. 350 million people's wishes never mattered.
<Quickshot> that's an assumption WDubya3
<WDubya3> Quickshot No it's not. The ballots were entered in the evidence.  They were never even browsed.
<WDubya3> Never even looked at one of them.
<Quickshot> WDubya3: It still makes it an assumption.  You havn't showed which laws matter most for the supreme court. or if they did it on personal interest.
<PhatEmu> america has been sold out by it's evil politicians
<WDubya3> How about we have murder trials, but the judge never looks at your DNA evidence. he just says, well... I don't have to look at that evidence or consider it at all?
<Quickshot> and?  That more suggests there might be a problem with your justice service.
<WDubya3> The court entered the ballots as evidence.  They could have refused to allow it. they did not do that. They allowed it because it was legally entered, but they refused to look at the evidence legally entered.
<Quickshot> I have no idea how US justice works. I can't comment on that.
<glassman> Quickshot, watch LA Law
<WDubya3> Well they concluded after Bush stall tactics that the SC did not have the time to look at all the ballots.
--- Starting response with 'ballots'
--- Responding: 'ballots were right thing, and that's a scattered network was raised legitimate questions about getting from bitter division in a terrorist networks are fantastic role of our time there are not last chapter of four with medicare '
<dubbya> ballots were right thing, and that's a scattered network was raised legitimate questions about getting from bitter division in a terrorist networks are fantastic role of our time there are not last chapter of four with medicare 
<Quickshot> never seen LA Law anywhere.
<WDubya3> That that would make a late president.
<glassman> are u aussie Quickshot?
<WDubya3> I'm not bitter, I'm just trying to recount the facts.
<WDubya3> hey it's done. heh!
<Quickshot> heh, hardly. EU.
<glassman> and some people claim that malaysian elections are not whatchamaccallit?
<glassman> are we heading for a split here?
<Quickshot> split?
<glassman> its too quiet
<Quickshot> ohhh.
<Quickshot> it's usually much more busy here?
<WDubya3> I'll be bok. Peace!  
<glassman> It is hard not to conclude that the president is ignorant, the secretary of defense nuts and the secretary of state incompetent
<Quickshot> that's true.
<glassman> most of them are in undernet's political
<Quickshot> kind of makes me glad I'm living in the EU.  there much more sane at the moment.
<PhatEmu> glassman and with this diagnoses what shall we do?
<glassman> - Noted historian and essayist Richard Reeves got both applause and catcalls for this stinging rebuke, delivered during the question and answer period of a Town Hall Today lecture held in Sarasota, Florida. But he got stunned silence and walk-outs galore when he predicted that Preznit Dubya would likely be assassinated over his recent decision to attack Iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq within the 11th, saddam hussein's links to have a method of kuwait, and other equipment needed to keep good for iraq within many of coalition members. '
<dubbya> iraq within the 11th, saddam hussein's links to have a method of kuwait, and other equipment needed to keep good for iraq within many of coalition members. 
<Quickshot> hmmm.
<PhatEmu> glassman, reeves has it all wrong
<glassman> kuwait was once iraq territory, but the brits secceded it to some sheikhs under their influence
--- Starting response with 'influence'
--- Responding: 'influence would likely maintains stockpiles of nations in opportunity to serve our government for the usa is for you teach a permanent rights of the chinese died under the oppressor? '
<dubbya> influence would likely maintains stockpiles of nations in opportunity to serve our government for the usa is for you teach a permanent rights of the chinese died under the oppressor? 
<PhatEmu> dubya represents the "establishment" no matter the gravity of his inhumanity, he's "made"; it's folks that aren't part of the establishment, the pioneers, that get capped 
<glassman> bush is gonna ask congress for ,, what was it,, 80 billion or 800 billion to cover the war..,, very smart
--- Starting response with 'smart'
--- Responding: 'smart enough to do nasty illegal activities '
<dubbya> smart enough to do nasty illegal activities 
<PhatEmu> he's not getting anymore $ from me!
<glassman> and I heard a US general saying that they needed only 25 million to get rid of terrorrist in south phillines
--- Starting response with 'phillines'
--- Responding: 'call it is cretaed .. not doesn't give strength '
<dubbya> call it is cretaed .. not doesn't give strength 
<PhatEmu> let them raise funds from cocaine sales
<PhatEmu> call it iraq-contra
--- Starting response with 'iraq-contra'
--- Responding: 'lol...this is not so are days that use them '
<dubbya> lol...this is not so are days that use them 
<glassman> If the US President is attacking Iraq because he ignored U.N. sanctions, why is he blowing off the U.N. procedure and attacking Iraq in spite of the express wishes of the U.N. members? 
--- Starting response with 'members'
--- Responding: 'members of a lot of power and nuclear weapons to meet the money is irrelevant...\ '
<dubbya> members of a lot of power and nuclear weapons to meet the money is irrelevant...\ 
<PhatEmu> because he is an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick
<glassman> For a country that is all about Constitutional rights, there sure are a LOT of people who can't stand to see folks express an opinion that is contrary to their own. Makes me wonder exactly how we could induce the production of a brain stem?
<PhatEmu> agreed glassman
<Quickshot> well he certaintly didn't give the UN inspectors much time to finish there work.
<PhatEmu> might makes right
<Quickshot> on the positive side, he did get them back in iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq has nuthin like i heard it '
<dubbya> iraq has nuthin like i heard it 
<glassman> do ya think theres gona be another election in 2004? or will dubya be impeach b4 then
<PhatEmu> all 300K of them huh?
<PhatEmu> :)
<atreyou> essex friks?
<Quickshot> even if iraq has nothing, it is fairing war in breach of the geneve convention. So saddam is a quite nasty person.
--- Starting response with 'person'
--- Responding: 'person between saddam hussein's ability to know a nuclear weapons program prior to chemical and all of the first time '
<dubbya> person between saddam hussein's ability to know a nuclear weapons program prior to chemical and all of the first time 
<PhatEmu> american people don't have the testicular fortitude to impeach a rogue resident of the white house - they're all too friggin chicken shit
<PhatEmu> if iraq had nukes, we wouldn't be warring against them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them out of the apparatus of the opportunity to encourage acts of your liberation '
<dubbya> them out of the apparatus of the opportunity to encourage acts of your liberation 
<glassman> Quickshot, the Gneva Convention is a UN resolution,, the war is not
<Quickshot> ummm, I believe the rules of war was before the UN.  But nevermind.
<PhatEmu> but we can be assured that saddam himself has a nuke as a last resort - all soldiers carry backups
<Quickshot> hmmm?
<glassman> if he hadda nuke and he is as crazy as they say he is, israel is already of the map long ago
<glassman> PhatEmu
<PhatEmu> indeed, so why are americans and iraqi dying in this war?
--- Starting response with 'war'
--- Responding: 'war in the us bring destruction '
<dubbya> war in the us bring destruction 
<glassman> I think there are more british casualties
<glassman> shot by US 
<Quickshot> heh.
<Quickshot> that and flying into each other.
<PhatEmu> swell
<glassman> hello  |Chuck||
<|Chuck||> 'Owdy, glassman
<|Chuck||> 'Sup?
<glassman> I am in malaysia  |Chuck||
<|Chuck||> You have my empathy
<glassman> and malaysia is the true fundamental islamic nation
<|Chuck||> The point being?
<glassman> al qaeda and the rest are idiots
<|Chuck||> Agreed, I have no use for those who would distort and pervert ANY of the world's great religions.
<Quickshot> well that's the hobby of all extremists and fundamentalists.
<|Chuck||> Again, agreed!
<|Chuck||> Did you folks hear what happened in Basrah?
<|Chuck||> The Shi'ites hit the fan!
<PhatEmu> dats a goot wun
<|Chuck||> Did you hear France has prohibited Euro_Disney from any further fireworks shows?
<Quickshot> you know, without all the oil, the fundamentalists would find it much harder to find funding.
<Kanok> hi
<Quickshot> ehh.., why did they do that?
<|Chuck||> Great point, Quickshot
<|Chuck||> They got tired of their troops surrendering every night.
<|Chuck||> Hi Kanok
<glassman> Quickshot,, u r twisting the word fundamentalist
<|Chuck||> Bye Knaok
<Quickshot> hmmm, a bit I guess.
<|Chuck||> More correct term would be Islamists.
<Quickshot> let's see a fundamentalist are people who take the book of there religion as the exact truth, not?
<glassman> we call them deviatinist
<|Chuck||> So sayeth many of the moderate Imams.
<glassman> we call them deviationist
<Kanok> re
<|Chuck||> re's
<glassman> fundamentalist are ones who take basis of their religion and practice it
<Quickshot> hmmm, well I know about fundamentalist christians, they are rather literal over the christian books.  Which isn't really very wise.
<|Chuck||> Actually, being a fundmentalist for any religion isn't bad, when t turns sour is when it's practitioners begin forcing their views on others.
<glassman> but Christian on trhe other hand are reading man written books call new testament and old testament
<|Chuck||> glassman, and what is the Quran but the same thing?
<glassman> nope
<glassman> the quran is the word of god sent thru gabriel to the prophet
<Quickshot> ahah, so via two mediums.
<Quickshot> and even if it's true. not original copy is left.
<Quickshot> not=no
<|Chuck||> And Christians believe God inspired certain men to scribe his words and teachings for posterity, much as the followers believe as they do about the Quran.
<Quickshot> so how can you know how reliable the current wording is, and secondly you can't know if you should regard it all, all to literally.
<|Chuck||> Personally, as a Christian myself, I believe ALL religions are valid.
<Quickshot> maybe, but I don't think they're all of equal value.
<glassman> Quickshot, god promise that he will protect and keep it true to its original form
<|Chuck||> They are to those who believe.    And it's really not our place to judge, is it?
<glassman> |Chuck||,, u mean told that some people are inspired>
<Quickshot> glassman: In my personal belief, the islam has fallen into the same problem as christianity and jews did in the past.  Making incorrect interpretations of the book.  No doubt there are many correct still, but today the day more then ever seem to be misusing it for there own purposes.
<glassman> yup. u r right
<|Chuck||> glassman, if I understand your question correctly, yes.
<glassman> jews, christian and islam are describe as heaven origin religion, unlike hinduism, budhist ore thje like
<glassman> they came from the same god
<Quickshot> and secondly has been checked that old versions are equal to new ones.
<|Chuck||> Yep
<glassman> only the quran is the final text and law
<|Chuck||> And therein, while I respect your view, I would disagree.
<glassman> the past , ie jesus times, only fit to jesus community, as well as Abraham times, only fit for abrahmic community
<glassman> but the quran fits mankind 
<Quickshot> that clearly can't work, as time passes, the best laws to implement become different.
<Quickshot> hmm, but jesus preached to the jews.
<glassman> inm the quran, it says that with its coming, the other two arte obselete
<|Chuck||> Gotta run, bye
<Quickshot> can be.
<glassman> Quickshot, but we are allowed adjustments to fit 
<Quickshot> but that doesn't mean they are wrong though.
<Quickshot> ahh, well it would help if many of the islamic countries implemented adjustments then.
<glassman> they are not wrong
<glassman> :)
<glassman> we are having problems here, with deviationist too
<Quickshot> ahah.
<Quickshot> well i was thinking saudi arabia or so you know.
<glassman> same as in pakistan, the talibbans are deviationist too
<glassman> do you know my prime minister?
<Quickshot> probably not, I don't know most nations prime ministers. So I don't feel to bad about it either. ^^
<glassman> DR Mahathir
<Quickshot> ok.
<Quickshot> and?
<glassman> he is one great dude
<glassman> many countries ie third world look up to him
<Quickshot> I'll take your word on it, there I don't know him.

<belmont^> god
<asilisaway> scuse me but you dont adopt a girl to later bed her
<belmont^> the naked vietnamese girl running from napalm bombs is not Mia Farrows adopted daughter LOL
<lifesuxx> revluci0n i heard that  a million times
<belmont^> asilisaway: are you sure he adopted her legally?
<asilisaway> okay i dint think so but ya never know
<ROBMAN432> well, all is fair in love and war, the most important thing is that he wasnt her biological father
<revluci0n> life, sorry
<belmont^> that vietnamese girl is now a middle aged woman
<asilisaway> he was living in a house with many children with mia as their FATHER
<glassman> leave allens affairs out of this OK?

<lifesuxx> revluci0n k
<asilisaway> he's a pervert
<ROBMAN432> well, she was an adult at the time
<asilisaway> doesnt mattah
<asilisaway> he's still a pervert
<CalCatLady> I think most of hollywood elites are a bunch of overgrown children with no common sense
<ROBMAN432> youre right there, i've heard enough from insiders
<belmont^> asilisaway: well there are always two sides to a story...yes he was legally the adopted father of some of those children when he was with Farrow but I believe that Soon Yee was not his adopted daughter
<glassman> asilisaway, I don't think he thinks he is one
<asilisaway> well yanno theres a big net out there and we can look it up
<revluci0n> the girls in his films get younger and younger
<CalCatLady> if everyone is so interested in that girl why doesn't someone look it up on the net
<belmont^> and if she was of age...then all it makes him is a cheating husband
<asilisaway> hes a perv i tell ya
<asilisaway> lol
<revluci0n> He's a perv, so what.
<asilisaway> he's a weasel
<asilisaway> yuck
<belmont^> his films are brilliant
<revluci0n> not really
<asilisaway> bah
<ROBMAN432> no she was of age i know that
<glassman> that is your view
<revluci0n> some aer funny
<CalCatLady> most hollywood are perverts just like polititians
<asilisaway> i avoid his films
<revluci0n> sleeper is one of my favorites
<asilisaway> they arent for everyone
<glassman> is allen a jew?
<belmont^> weasel yes...but so arent many people...to judge his films because of his personal life is silly...it has nothing to do with art
<ROBMAN432> yes
<asilisaway> who the hell cares
<revluci0n> Yuppo
<ROBMAN432> exactly asilisaway
<ROBMAN432> i'm sure he doesnt care that much
<asilisaway> i judged his films by my own personal entertainment levels and i dont like em
<belmont^> asilisaway: yeah right...not with that judgement you have..hehe
<glassman> we don't get that many films here, mostly commercially viable films 4 the masses
<belmont^> there isnt anything he could do in a movie that you would like now because you think he is a perv
<ROBMAN432> he's just a guy with a personal life
<asilisaway> i have an opinion yer welcum to disagree
<belmont^> glassman: you are missing out on some wonderful smaller films
<glassman> yeah
<glassman> :(
<belmont^> glassman: Ill mail some to ya hehe ;)
<asilisaway> no i dont watch his movies because I dont find them entertaining.. i think he's a perv because he raised the kid he eventually fucked
<glassman> but films 4 me are not merely 4 entertaining
<ROBMAN432> i like some of his movies
<belmont^> LOL
<glassman> th kid is not his to begin with
<ROBMAN432> very odd way of observing things, that's his genius
<belmont^> asilisaway: that is so off base hehe...he didnt raise Soon Yee!
<Makimota> hello
<belmont^> and you say you dont care hehe
<glassman> and the end of it
<asilisaway> he lived in the house as the father figure
<ROBMAN432> well, she was probably very subservient by nature, and welcomed it
<belmont^> asilisaway: you are assuming that...you do not know if he was a father to her...she was of age
<asilisaway> ya and he is a letch by nature and took advantage
<ROBMAN432> he wanted a young girl
<ROBMAN432> of age mind you
<glassman> let get this outta here ok people, enough of allen
<belmont^> who doesnt as long as they are of age? :)
<ROBMAN432> exactly
<revluci0n> Nothing wrong with an age difference as long as consent is there
<revluci0n> and majority
<ROBMAN432> exactly
<asilisaway> she wasnt of age when it first bacme an issue
<belmont^> consent is essential of course
<ROBMAN432> we dont know that asilisaway
<asilisaway> he was letchin before she turned 18
<asilisaway> lets look it up
<ROBMAN432> how do you know that?
<glassman> yeah , and some did reply that 2 me when I said that Bush's daughters are acoholics
--- Starting response with 'acoholics'
--- Responding: 'and that's chemical weapons... '
<dubbya> and that's chemical weapons... 
<asilisaway> i member
<asilisaway> it sickened me
<ROBMAN432> i think some of the groundwork was there for it yes, but i dont think he was sexual with her before she was of age
<glassman> or titotallers
<belmont^> you dont have to be 18...perhaps to have sex but not to be in a relationship
<Quickshot> bye
<ROBMAN432> that's true belmont
<ROBMAN432> many men go for younger women, women of age
<belmont^> CalCatLady: what is your solution?

<glassman> CalCatLady,, how come they drop some on residential houses? no where near any military zone, samrt bomb my foot!!!
<asilisaway> shit happens
<ROBMAN432> i have a logical question, why would anyone ever want to be a democrat
<asilisaway> hehee
<belmont^> they need to begin NOT worrying about civilian casualties as much as worrying about the lives of the troops
<ROBMAN432> true belmont
<Chilled> maybe they bombed those houses because there were people tied to saddam in there ?
<ROBMAN432> a tough war to win
<belmont^> Chilled: good point
<ROBMAN432> no, a mistake
<ROBMAN432> it's a war, it happens
<CalCatLady> i think people are too worried about where the shells hit.. no one worried about that during WW1 or WW2
<belmont^> not tough unless you concern yourself with public outcry than in securing your own soldiers
<asilisaway> we dont really know so it must be time ti diddle
<asilisaway> -i+o
<Chilled> times and situations is different now Cal
<ROBMAN432> no one got the same degree of reporting as we do today
<asilisaway> hehehee
<glassman> Chilled> yeah, maybe
<CapeGuy> Mistakes happen ... Bush Jnr was a mistake, the current war is a mistake ...
--- Starting response with ''

<asilisaway> yer a wanker notta diddler

<belmont^> asilisaway: I may need some pointers...not sure where the foot goes...or the hand...*
<CalCatLady> too much reporting to my taste

<asilisaway> lol
<asilisaway> you gotcher wanker in my diddle
<Chilled> same here... they're turning the war into a mini series made for tv
<ROBMAN432> yeah, 9/11 was a mistake i suppose too capeguy
<belmont^> lol
<belmont^> wait...I thought that was yer waddle!
<asilisaway> lol
<asilisaway> lmao
<CapeGuy> ROB:  The causes of 9/11 were, sure ... the Banana War with Europe among general arrogant bullying around the world ...
<glassman> I believe many things are orchestrated to fulfil some peoples targets
<CalCatLady> if all those countries such at France don't want to back us finacially and militarily they should give us all the monies owned to us since before WW1
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Totally unnecessary, cause the US could learn empire from Britain, France, Spain, Germany, Russia, Italy ...
<CalCatLady> stop helping all those countries including with food, medical supplies etc
<ROBMAN432> and what evidence did you have that hitler was not a peaceful loving guy before wwi
<Chilled> the money russia, france and germany alone owe us would pay for the war and the reconstruction
<glassman> how did saddam get to power? how did Idi Amin get to power? how did Kuwaiti Sheiks get to power?
<revluci0n> moo.
<ROBMAN432> by the way europe and the un arent the world's governing body
<CapeGuy> Chilled:  USA is in the red with the world, not the black ...
<UnleashMyDragon> americanz wonder why we hate them...DON'T THEY WATCH  NEWZ!?
<ROBMAN432> other way around i believe cape
<Chilled> where are you dragon ?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Nope ... God is, and Bushkins refuses to listen to his (Methodist) bishops!
--- Starting response with 'bishops'
--- Responding: 'americans are under the iraqi people and destroying all to make sure ... it kept moving ever seem illogical on aspirilia... he has chem, and nuclear weapons represents good, saddam hussein is to be debates, like it's practitioners begin with iraqi soldiers were based on american ?? '
<dubbya> americans are under the iraqi people and destroying all to make sure ... it kept moving ever seem illogical on aspirilia... he has chem, and nuclear weapons represents good, saddam hussein is to be debates, like it's practitioners begin with iraqi soldiers were based on american ?? 
<Chilled> love when someone makes a comment like that and then leaves
<revluci0n> heh
<glassman> UnleashMyDragon,, they watch hololywood more
<ROBMAN432> do we really need the un? what good has it done for the US, i think theyve been paid quite a few times over by us in advance
<CalCatLady> soo li was adopted was when adopted by mia and a music conductor that she was hooked up with at time they got her from Korea
<ROBMAN432> by the way it is UN resolutions that the US have the only guts to enforce, in an ironic way we're doing their dirty work for them already
<glassman> ROBMAN432, typical US thinking, what benefit them, say not what the country can for you, but what can u  do for the country
<ROBMAN432> or should i say once again
<ROBMAN432> typical, so much of the world loves that adjective
<glassman> should be change to say not what the world can do 4 u but what u can do 4 the world
<ROBMAN432> obviously the UN and rest of the world for that matter need us much more than we them, with the exception of china perhaps
<CapeGuy> ROB:  The UN said "wait", but Bush and Blair were already committed with expensive military in the area.
--- Starting response with 'area'
--- Responding: 'th kid he could create the people. '
<dubbya> th kid he could create the people. 
<ROBMAN432> wait another 12 years?
<ROBMAN432> or wait for nukes to hit our shores instead of our own planes?
<ROBMAN432> which waiting do you prefer?
<glassman> ROBMAN432, what about the 30 year old resolutions telling Israel to withdraw to original borders?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Waiting another 12 years is better than having The Lady, Empire State, San Fran Bridge and every symbol of America flattened by a new generation of terrorists!
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists detained in the war against these 12 years, iraq and that agreement '
<dubbya> terrorists detained in the war against these 12 years, iraq and that agreement 
<ROBMAN432> israel was invaded in 67, so they are holding the high ground, they didnt bring that on themselves
<ROBMAN432> i think that's the very thing we're out to avoid by taking iraq out of the equation
--- Starting response with 'equation'
--- Responding: 'my own personal interest. '
<dubbya> my own personal interest. 
<glassman> and bush is gona ask congress to release 80 billion or ist 800 billion 2 cover the war
--- Starting response with 'war'
--- Responding: 'war on foreign oil they only fit to be able to hell im not telling how do you saying it '
<dubbya> war on foreign oil they only fit to be able to hell im not telling how do you saying it 
<Chilled> what about the palestinians who killed israeli's that started the war that israel conquered the land for ?  tell the parents (if they havent been killed also) that the lives lost during the war was for nothing ?
<glassman> is it
<ROBMAN432> 80 billion is 3 days or less then our entire GDP
<CalCatLady> the middle east has been fighting since the beginning of time they will never change
<ROBMAN432> not a problem
<glassman> ROBMAN432>,, that make it legaL?
<asilisaway> belmont has put me into diddle mode... later yallllllll
<Chilled> problem is back in 42 when the UN was established and the GAVE the land to the jews to begin with.... but you can't undo that now
<asilisaway> LOL
<belmont^> LOL
<belmont^> bye now hehe
<ROBMAN432> it is legal, they are the UN resolutions
<asilisaway> byeeeeee
<revluci0n> bye
<ROBMAN432> severe consequences = war, dont you think?
<Chilled> yes it was glassman
<CalCatLady> just quit buying their oil and see how fast they stop fighting since they all want american $$
<ROBMAN432> we dont need authority from the un to protect ourselves
<revluci0n> ROBMAN,charter says all war must be explicitly permitted by security council
<ROBMAN432> not in the US charter, vote by congress
<glassman> u tthink people are after USD?
<revluci0n> the UN charter
<ROBMAN432> again the UN doesnt govern the US
<glassman> lol
<Chilled> and if the leftests in the states stopped fighting the expansion in Alaska of fuel oil none of this would be happening... like who cares if one more owl dies ? gimme a break
<revluci0n> we are a member state aint we
<ROBMAN432> no i think that the war is easy to pay off
<ROBMAN432> amen chilled
<ROBMAN432> a member state? what is that?
<glassman> US citizens think that the rest of the world are panhandlers
<CalCatLady> kicke the UN out of the USA
<Chilled> what does that mean glassman ?
<CalCatLady> rest of world are panhandlings
<glassman> <CalCatLady> just quit buying their oil and see how fast they stop fighting since they all want american $$
<ROBMAN432> would it offend you if the US didnt have an opion at all about who you are?
<ROBMAN432> the UN isnt in the US thankfully, they just dont realize that
<revluci0n> I hope the US doesnt have any opinion on who I am in the slightest
<Chilled> lol and to think two years ago bush didnt even know the name of the french pres ! oh this is all so funny when you step back and look at it
--- Starting response with 'it'
--- Responding: 'it has a year which can change and respectful, and the oppression of sledging? '
<dubbya> it has a year which can change and respectful, and the oppression of sledging? 
<ROBMAN432> rest assure then
<CalCatLady> I don't buy foreign oil
<glassman> what people want is peace so that they can get on with their lives
<CalCatLady> i don't even have a car
<ROBMAN432> do we need an historian to be president? or a member of his administrative staff, its not just one guy you know
<glassman> they don't want aid that they have to pay back tenfolds
<ROBMAN432> is Iraq a peaceful country?
--- Starting response with 'country'
--- Responding: 'country poses a symbol of the united nations '
<dubbya> country poses a symbol of the united nations 
<ROBMAN432> is that what they say in kuwait?
<ROBMAN432> the US poses a symbol of itself thank you
<ROBMAN432> is that what the kurds say too?
<Chilled> payback? since when does anyone ever payback ?
<ROBMAN432> we pay enough
<CalCatLady> We should not help rebuild Iraq after the war either -- no americian $$ going to middle east
--- Starting response with 'east'
--- Responding: 'east have no more scuds or injured nearly 900 people, medical care to serve our resolve, we want to the un '
<dubbya> east have no more scuds or injured nearly 900 people, medical care to serve our resolve, we want to the un 
<CapeGuy> The USA has told other countries to close Iraqi missions and expel staff, freeze assets ... what stupidity!
--- Starting response with 'stupidity'
--- Responding: 'well advised to belittle our coalition military action, but thaey are all those obligations as been firing into kuwait the same reason i make more companies to commit an arsenal from the un weapons inspector of nations security council to make our environment in there are all :)) '
<dubbya> well advised to belittle our coalition military action, but thaey are all those obligations as been firing into kuwait the same reason i make more companies to commit an arsenal from the un weapons inspector of nations security council to make our environment in there are all :)) 
<ROBMAN432> yes we should rebuild iraq, i agree we should
--- Starting response with 'should'
--- Responding: 'should be longer in cheif '
<dubbya> should be longer in cheif 
<ROBMAN432> why is that stupid?
<ROBMAN432> should we recommend they support iraq while we're at war with them?
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them on anything. how will meet today, we wouldn't destroy iraq's people come to an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick '
<dubbya> them on anything. how will meet today, we wouldn't destroy iraq's people come to an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick 
<CapeGuy> How the hell will they be monitored for terrorists they breed, disbursal of funds etc?
--- Starting response with 'etc'
--- Responding: 'before it could have an objective analysis '
<dubbya> before it could have an objective analysis 
<ROBMAN432> based on the interests of the countries that we are asking, which i assume are very dependent on us as it is
<ROBMAN432> ?
<glassman> Chilled> se indonesia, follow the routine or else no aid

<ROBMAN432> see north korea? how much better are they?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Exactly, we are weary of it ... Planet Hollywood and two others in my city!  You guys must entertain your terrs at home now, please!
<glassman> <CalCatLady  ever heard of royalties or what ever the terhm they use?
<ROBMAN432> i think that should be allowed, we are america and should be able to produce better product, else allow us to spend our money on imports
<ROBMAN432> i dont follow your point cape
<glassman> KFC, McD, all get a cut froim busines in these countries
<CalCatLady> no imports! Imports put AMerican workers out of work
<ROBMAN432> lol, it's a kid's restauraunt

<ROBMAN432> yes, it's a war
<ROBMAN432> it's a war
<glassman> CalCatLady,, busineseess put workers out of work, employers put workers out of work, not imports
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Good ... enjoy your bombings in the USA then, and don't weep any more about the WTC!
<CalCatLady> i am sorry about kids being hurt, but how many of them have weapons of some kind and do what the kids in Nam did to our soldiers
<ROBMAN432> that's why we're fighting, we were already bombed without a war on 9/11
<ROBMAN432> so why so surprised that we want to stop someone from doing it again?
<glassman> what this war is gonna create is anyones guess
<CapeGuy> ROB:  VERY belatedly -- we elsewhere in the West have taken your bombs before the WTC, and we're tired of it.
<ROBMAN432> everyone needs us until we find a need to stop people from killing us
<ROBMAN432> so let's maybe put a stop to it? dont you think?
<CalCatLady> well got to go and get ready for work

<CapeGuy> Glass:  The ones now in power, Colin aside, are twits.
<ROBMAN432> no, i think we're somewhat afraid though of being attacked again
<belmont^> CapeGuy: I would agree they are twits...but they do follow through on what they say

<ROBMAN432> i just dont want to be killed while in the wtc in my city
<Bullgator> Her name is Phan Thi Kim Phuc and she  was named a UNESCO goodwill ambassador
<ROBMAN432> that's real enough for me

<glassman> Bullgator,, yup, was she mia farrows and woody allen's adopted girl?
<belmont^> lol
<Bullgator> no .. glassman she wasn't
<belmont^> here is an online story about that girl http://www.womentodaymagazine.com/features/kim_phuc.html

<belmont^> lol
<belmont^> no news
<ROBMAN432> oh ok
<belmont^> he somehow snuck himself in there...like he does with all his kids LOL
<ROBMAN432> Woody isnt really on my list today sorry
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: WOody or "a woddy"? LOL
<ROBMAN432> he can screw whomever he wants, as long as they are of age and want it back
<Bullgator> beats me ROBMAN432 .. someone asked me about it in another channel .. she left .. thought I'd tell ya'll 
<belmont^> Bullgator: thanks for the info
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Trouble is the USA presents itself so much through Hollywood, not Washington.

<Bullgator> ya'll take care .. laterz
<ROBMAN432> late
<belmont^> CapeGuy: no...the US does not present itself through Hollywood...people CHOOSE for themselves as to how they wish to view the US
<ROBMAN432> exactly, they watch the news like it's a talk show
<glassman> ROBMAN432, I was telling about when that foto of the napalm bomb girl came out in the papers, that I saw it when it 1st came out

<ROBMAN432> glass: yeah?
<ROBMAN432> i remember that photo
<ROBMAN432> close minded more like, have you tried talking about abortion with a democrat? or god forbid lighting a cigarette?
<CapeGuy> Glass:  That photo must be the most remembers in the world.
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: sorry I cant agree with you there...I think anyone who labels themselves by a political affiliation needs therapy :)
<belmont^> I independently think for myself :)
<ROBMAN432> it's our innate need to belong to some form of membership
<glassman> Bullgator>  also the foto of vietnamese captain executing a suspected vietcong spy in south vietnam,, saying that we already that old
<ROBMAN432> yes glassman

<belmont^> thats the latest
<ROBMAN432> not sure, it was the ending of the war
<glassman> the movie cos I don't or didn't see the foto u r talking about
<belmont^> I think the picture of the sailor kissing a girl was in a US city somewhere...
<belmont^> perhaps new york
<glassman> but I remember the foto of returning US soldier being greeted by family, very heart warming
<ROBMAN432> it was a celebration of wwII ending, i think ticker taped, and this sailor was dipping this nurse and kissing her
<ROBMAN432> yes belmont
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: yes...ticker taped...thats why I thought it may be New york where such parades are famous
<ROBMAN432> right
<ROBMAN432> supposed to be the most famous picture ever
<ROBMAN432> i heard it might have been staged though
<belmont^> couldbe
<ROBMAN432> they never found the people again to ask
<ROBMAN432> that were in the photo
<belmont^> though that cover of National Geographic of that Afghani girl with the amazing eyes is pretty memorable
<Bullgator> 12B14y 12T14he 12W14ay belmont^ .. you have seen that pic right ???

<Bullgator> ok .. just wonderin
<ROBMAN432> good question
<KurtChicago> Why doesn't the USAF drop MOABs on the Republican Guard???
<ROBMAN432> so far the most memorable is when Bush was nearly brought to tears while choking on words describing his anger and frustration against 9/11
--- Starting response with '9/11'

<belmont^> she is married to David Bowie, yes?
<KurtChicago> Iman, the somali chick, is married to David Bowie
<KurtChicago> He likes chocolate
<ROBMAN432> the afghan girl's eyes are the most amazing i've ever seen
<glassman> maybe that someone who pluck Iman from the savannahs can pluck this girl to fame
<belmont^> KurtChicago: it aint all that bad :)
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: my father used to subscribe to National Geographic when I was young and I remember that cover...so striking...
<belmont^> amazing they found her
<ROBMAN432> incredible
<Bullgator> lol, when you were young
<glassman> belmont^, when one can see beauty in one's color, the one is in darkness
<belmont^> glassman: not sure what you mean
<glassman> I must add only
<KurtChicago> i prefer blond women
<glassman> Bullgator, the foto that I saw when young was in different angle
<Bullgator> There were a couple of diff photos of that .. but that one was the most famous
<glassman> with the girls mouth wide open and crying
<belmont^> ok guys...here it is...the picture of the sailor kissing the girl...it took place in times square on VJ day
<belmont^> http://www.iconblvd.com/picts/life/3_V-J-Day.jpg

<ROBMAN432> or the nurse
<glassman> I know that one
<KurtChicago> What about Brody kissking Hale Berry?
<ROBMAN432> yes, the most famous photo ever
<glassman> but I think the sailor just taking advantage of the atmosphere
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: on that same site you can do a search on afghan girl and they have a signed poster, signed by the photographer...of the afghan girl
<glassman> lol
<Bullgator> http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0311_020312_sharbat.html

<belmont^> ohgod
<KurtChicago> Bullgator, and did the GI's impale that bitch?
<belmont^> how do you fight such an enemny other than to consider them all the enemy?
<Bullgator> Needless to say .. she, the baby and many standing around are not with us today
<glassman> vietnam maybe asian, like I am but I am muslim, 
<belmont^> Bullgator: I hope our soldiers do the same in this warm and stop worrying about being so strategic
<belmont^> Rodgers: 1,000 armed vehicles in convoy, could reach U.S. troops tonight
<ROBMAN432> why arent the US just hitting them from the air?
<glassman> belmont^> Rodgers, some one is gonna get cooked tonight
<KurtChicago> I believe that when civilians start attacking troops, then they should be attacked back... 
<Bullgator> glassman I have nothing against the Muslim people or Asian people .. but those that use religon to kill and maim innocent people have no place on this earth
<ROBMAN432> normally they are considered army infantry if they attack
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: I am hoping that they have a plan to wait until they are as far away from baghdad so they cannot retreat and then shell the hell out of them
<glassman> KurtChicago,, I agree
<ROBMAN432> right belmont
<ROBMAN432> there is no element of surprise at least
<belmont^> ROBMAN432`: they have that MOAB bomb...this is the perfect time to use the mother :)
<glassman> KurtChicago but only the ones with gun in hand
<Bullgator> If it was me I'd bring back Napalm
<ROBMAN432> the US should block from the rear and surround them
<glassman> Bullgator,, u wouldn't like to be there, why u wish some one else be there ?
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: I dont know that we have enough soldiers on the ground there to do that
<Bullgator> glassman if my health was good .. I'd be there in a heartbeat
<glassman> I mean in the napalm range
<ROBMAN432> well, block any ability for retreat by blowing behind them from air
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: from your lips to Tommy Franks' ears
<ROBMAN432> lol, like i know anything
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: you know enough to know we should be far concern with the safety of our troops than Iraqi civilians when they are being used as human shields

<dubbya> shields for health care, and situations is only derives little to my rage 
<Bullgator> glassman .. they (Sadam's Republic Guards) are killing their own people there is nothing that I wouldn't do to try to stop the inhumane acts 
<glassman> In Vietnam the veterans organizations are very meager. There have not been much assistance for war veterans 
<ROBMAN432> i wish there was a way to just convince them to surrender
<glassman> from the pics
<glassman> why would u create more vets?
<Bullgator> glassman .. explane that ???
<glassman> that was a sentence from the url u gave, so why create more vets? when even vietnam vets are not assisted properly
<Bullgator> I know veterans are getting cut short by the G'vt right now .. but organizations like the American Leigon and VFW are trying to help as much as they can
<glassman> don't people ever learn?
<ROBMAN432> theyll learn
<glassman> right now? 
<glassman> how long has it been since the vietnam war?
<Bullgator> My health care has been cut back a little because of G've cut backs .. but the Veterans organizations are trying to get them increased

<ROBMAN432> no reported damages yet
<ROBMAN432> they are currently engaged in battle
<RufusTFirefly> Cracks me up how the media reports on the war on a minute by minute basis, like a war is fought that way.
<Bullgator> I agree RufusTFirefly
<ROBMAN432> what do you mean?
<glassman> RufusTFirefly> do not be too happy over war
<RufusTFirefly> "We'll have more war coverage, right after these messages."
<RufusTFirefly> Who said I was happy about it, glassman?
<Bullgator> and, watching this news conference, I am still amazed at the dumb questions that reporters ask

<RufusTFirefly> Yeah, I'm on the funny side, and you're on the unfunny side.
<ROBMAN432> is that what the war is about?
<glassman> do you people really believe that this war is about liberation?

<glassman> Bullgator,, you think all muslims, will sit still? 
<Bullgator> That could be
<Bullgator> glassman .. it's not about muslims it's about FREEDOM from opression
<ROBMAN432> right bullgator
<ROBMAN432> what he said
<glassman> this is a war against thier brothers ,mine too, but I am sane, and open, unlike the talibans, or some other leser educated muslim
<ROBMAN432> so only the smart ones are your brothers?
<glassman> all are , u too
<ROBMAN432> this isnt a holy war as far as i can determine
<glassman> its disguise, but is a holy war
<Bullgator> Correct ROBMAN432 .. it's NOT a holy war .. it's about FREEDOM
<ROBMAN432> that's the problem, everyone who cant really justify themselves in time of war make it a war about religion, everyone suddenly has god on their side
<Bullgator> so glassman .. you are saying that you would like to live under the likes of Sadam ??
<glassman> it the culmination of an orchestrated......... I don't know the word
<Bullgator> There has been more people killed in the name of "God" than for any other cause in history
<ROBMAN432> call it what you want, i just dont want anyone killing us in the name of whatever god you think tells you to
<ROBMAN432> EXACTLY bullgator
<glassman> we are not taught to kill
<ROBMAN432> no? who teaches it? god?
<glassman> that the kind of misinformation you are fed on
<Bullgator> glassman .. did anyone say that you are ??
<ROBMAN432> i feel realistically informed
<xLapatsas> Bullgator: and probably as many (if not anymore) in the name of money/greed
<glassman> anyone killing us in the name of god
<ROBMAN432> saddam isnt greedy?
<xLapatsas> anymore = manymor
<Bullgator> xLapatsas .. but most of those go back to "In the name of God" 
<ROBMAN432> yep
<glassman> bush did say in the name of god, I presume?

<dubbya> who saddam hussein still amazing... 
<ROBMAN432> i'm so tired with that holy war thing, and greed for money motive that the people are too blind to see, what crap
<xLapatsas> Bullgator: the "in the name of god" is an excuse, not the reason, historically most/if not all the wars have been faught for dominance, rerources, money/power etc
