<captain_proton> shame'
<scanline> how'd that happen so fast?
<gonkulator> its the brownies
<captain_proton> refridgerator too warm?
<scanline> and worst of all, I noticed this while pouring it in some chai...
<scanline> it was on the second coldest setting.. assuming the "min" setting is coldest
<gonkulator> doh...
<scanline> hmm...
<captain_proton> that sucks
<scanline> the "off" setting is right next to "min" which would seem to indicate that it's the warmest setting
<scanline> but it's labeled "temperature"...
<scanline> bah
<captain_proton> min is the warmest
<scanline> grr...
<captain_proton> gonkulator: you probably turned it to max, which is close to off
<scanline> wow, michael's computer really doesn't sound good
<darth_iBook> well, I think I'm making progress
<gonkulator> scanline: its gonna die
<gonkulator> scanline or captain_proton:: where did you get those funny posters?
<scanline> gonkulator: yeah... the CPU fan is nearly dead, and instead of replacing it he stuck a desk fan near the back of his computer. really stupid....
<scanline> http://homepage.mac.com/leperous/PhotoAlbum1.html
<darth_iBook> scanline: are you talking about michael?
<scanline> darth_iBook: yes
<scanline> he didn't even open the case and point a fan at the CPU, he just sort of pointed it near the power supply
<darth_iBook> lol
<scanline> I hope the chai concentrate is still good...
<scanline> and that leftover rice
<darth_iBook> bugger
<scanline> hmm.. looks like jorrit is going to give me write access to crystal space's CVS
<darth_iBook> scanline: can you explain to me what the channel does on my wifi network?
<scanline> and soon the Surface porting shall commence :)
<scanline> darth_iBook: it changes the radio frequency the network uses. usually the default is good
<scanline> you'd only normally change it to avoid interference, or use several networks near each other
<darth_iBook> how do you know what the default is?
<scanline> for base stations I think the default is channel 1, 802.11b cards usually default to autodetecting the channel
<darth_iBook> bugger
<darth_iBook> I am becoming convinced that this will never work

<merlin262> is there a way to filter mail based on the body text in mozilla?
<captain_proton> with tofu it will require some creativeness with the recipe
<darth_iBook> that's why they're 'experiments' in culinary engineering ;)
<captain_proton> the recipe uses chicken, and cooks beforehand

<gonkulator> [15:35:31] 	<gezr>	ylai : in a place of multiple cultures languages, such terms are not necessary to convey meaning.
<gonkulator> [15:35:38] 	<gezr>	Haggaro : because you have to use them as well.
<gonkulator> [15:35:38] 	<Bsew>	just the humanitarian reasons alone,  are good enough reasons to go in and take out saddam we dont need to even get to WMD or chemicals hes killed over 200,000 ppl
<gonkulator> [15:36:11] 	<rich_>	Gnug225 Oh I see.
<gonkulator> [15:36:13] 	<Bsew>	thats more then the whole  vietnam war
<gonkulator> [15:36:22] 	<ylai>	gezr: It depends on the people you are speaking to, I think.
<gonkulator> [15:36:34] 	<gezr>	Haggaro : you can also learn from listening or reading books that are far beyond your level. I have to guess your in highshool or such. so read some books that appear large, when you find something you dont understand look it up
<gonkulator> [15:36:39] 	<gezr>	ylai : exactly
<gonkulator> [15:36:46] 	<JC_>	The humanitarian reasons are great, but not many believe that they are the true reasons... many believe its oil, pure and simple.
