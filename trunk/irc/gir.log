<scanline> yeah
<ToyKeeper> I've been meaning to implement chains longer than 1 into my similar text mangler.
<ToyKeeper> I've got a two-piece text mangler...  one piece generates formal grammar definitions by analyzing text, markov-style.  The other piece generates random phrases based on a grammar.
<scanline> cool
<scanline> this was just a quick and dirty hack, originally intended to be a mockery of Bush :)
<scanline> fed a bunch of bush quotes and speeches into it and put it on DALnet #politics as 'dubbya'

<gonkulator> While poking around the 'net last week I visited O'Reilly --*the* definitive library for geeks-- and discovered that Tim and his staff are celebrating "25 Years of Animal Magnetism." 25 years! That is just way impressive. It got me wondering just how many geeks owe their fabulous skillset to O'Reilly books? A quick glance around our home office reveals 5 O'Reilly publications, and that's not including the others that are stashed aro
<gonkulator> se. How many O'Reilly books are on your bookshelf?  
<gonkulator> So, feeling all warm and fuzzy,  I created a happy anniversary banner from the UF furball to O'Reilly for our site and decided to send it over to Tim. He loves it and it's been posted on a special page at O'Reilly where everyone can wish them Happy Anniversary. So get over there and give them a pat on the back for being the supreme geek resource for 25 years!

<scanline> lessee....
<scanline> I would have used the STL, but I'm guessing this was supposed to be an excersise in making your own linked list
<scanline> I would have put all the strings for the hangman board in the drawMan function
<ToyKeeper> hehehe...  I hate the way c++ does templates.
<scanline> I would have made menu() return the choice rather than having to pass by reference
<scanline> ToyKeeper: I'm not a big fan of templates myself, but if you're programming in C++ anyway you might as well use them
<ToyKeeper> Yeah, that's true.  I still generally prefer void pointers over c++ templates though.
<scanline> would have made readFile return a vector of some sort, rather than an array of strings and a separate count variable. At the least, a structure with both in it.
<darth_iBook> scanline: I'd thought of having menu() return the choice, I guess it's just the way I learned to do it by ref
<scanline> ToyKeeper: same here
<darth_iBook> this wasn't an assignment though, it's something I'm doing for my mom
<darth_iBook> she wants a hangman program for her students, this was a small prototype I did just to see if I could
<scanline> darth_iBook: one argument for doing it the way you did is that it's more self-documenting, since you have the name of the variable you're returning in... but it's even easier to read if you name the function getMenuChoice() and have it return the choice
<darth_iBook> I see
<scanline> darth_iBook: yep, I said I didn't see anything wrong with it, just things I'd do differently
<darth_iBook> oki
<darth_iBook> I was just wondering what you'd do differently, get a different perspective
<darth_iBook> also, I wanna make it all pretty and pointy-clicky for the kids, any suggestions on what to use for that?
<darth_iBook> I was thinking of doing it over in python
<ToyKeeper> Python is awesome.  It's made me sooooo lazy.
<captain_proton> hm
<captain_proton> xmode2 is cool
<scanline> yeah, perhaps python plus wxwindows
<darth_iBook> cuz it seems like it might be easier to do the grafix in python, and lists and stuff would make it easier
<captain_proton> pygtk!
<darth_iBook> wxwindows?
<scanline> or pygtk
<scanline> or picogui :)
<darth_iBook> ^_^
<darth_iBook> it's gonna run on a mac, I don't know if it's os x or what
<ToyKeeper> Even the thought of having to implement my own lists and hashes and such makes me feel bleh, after using python.
<merlin262> ugh, I give up
<scanline> darth_iBook: ah, in that case you should pick wxwindows or anygui
<ToyKeeper> darth: wxwindows may be a good choice, then.  It's pretty portable...
<darth_iBook> oki
<merlin262> gentoo has too many linuxisms
<darth_iBook> merlin262: ?
<scanline> merlin262: trying to port gentoo to bsd?
<ToyKeeper> gentoo is a linux distro...  how can it be "too linux"?
<merlin262> scanline: yes
<scanline> haha
<scanline> alright
<ToyKeeper> Ah, okay.  :)
<ToyKeeper> Um.  Ports?
<merlin262> I want the gentoo ports system 
<merlin262> on MacOS X
<merlin262> cause fink sucks
<ToyKeeper> Why not BSD ports?
<merlin262> hey
<ToyKeeper> Since, uh, wasn't gentoo a clone of bsd ports anyway?
<merlin262> yea
<ToyKeeper> I don't know in detail how they differ, but...
<captain_proton> gentoo added a bunch of features
<captain_proton> it works
<darth_iBook> wow, big dl
<darth_iBook> omg, is this the first episode of sg1?
<scanline> on navi?
<darth_iBook> on scifi
<darth_iBook> I think it is!
<scanline> I have the pilot on navi if you want to watch it
<darth_iBook> cool
<scanline> ah
<scanline> le netvuurk sciife?
<darth_iBook> it is! they're forming sg1 in a meeting right now
<darth_iBook> yay!
<ToyKeeper> scanline: you need to get more space on navi, so I can fill it up.  :)
<scanline> you should see it from the beginning
<darth_iBook> lol
<scanline> ToyKeeper: indeed. I want your anime :)
<darth_iBook> who, me?
<ToyKeeper> 'course, I need to get a couple spools back from hardwire and hallesthai first...

<merlin262> anyone seen Carpman lately?
<merlin262> hmm
<darth_iBook> not I
<scanline> ask ibot?
<merlin262> PicoBot: seen carpman
<PicoBot> carpman was last seen on #tacobeam 12 days, 10 hours, 15 minutes and 23 seconds ago, saying: sets up a trap for merlin262, so that the next time he talks on IRC, he will be unable to leave. [Sat Mar 15 07:12:24 2003]
<merlin262> PicoBot: seen carpman{sasami}
<PicoBot> carpman{sasami} was last seen on #picogui 107 days, 20 hours, 57 minutes and 49 seconds ago, saying: gonkulator: ERROR, YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR FILES. :) [Mon Dec  9 20:30:04 2002]
<Xent> yeah... about 12 days...
<merlin262> hmmm
<captain_proton> scanline: where is the calibration value?
<scanline> captain_proton: on a fresh chip it will be in the lower 8 bits of the last location in memory, in one that we've programmed it will be the lower 8 bits at 0x000
<captain_proton> hmm
<captain_proton> another 054
<scanline> I think only 4 or 5 bits of that 8 is actually used, the lower bits are always zero
<scanline> so it's not that surprising
<darth_iBook> captain_proton: did you wanna perform that experiment on saturday night?
<darth_iBook> I should be back in town by then
<merlin262> hmmm
<captain_proton> darth_iBook: sunday would be better
<darth_iBook> okis
<captain_proton> geez
<captain_proton> he's holding a poll on where to put an ad?
<darth_iBook> s/maro/mario
<darth_iBook> afk a sec
<scanline> captain_proton: yikes.. I hadn't actually read the site, it was too gray :)
<captain_proton> After a little while of talking with a local tanker, Noodleman (Tuck McLean) said that he would allow him to host me for free; No ads, nothing. But I will put in a few ads of SBO and Noodleroni.com. After all, it's the least I could do! Maybe along the left margin? Or the right? Or along the bottom! That would be great... E-Mail me and tell me what you think. Remeber, please put in the words "Ad bar Poll" as the subject.
<darth_iBook> yay
<scanline> captain_proton: scary
<captain_proton> very
<darth_iBook> who is doing that poll?
<captain_proton> darth_iBook: one of the bz kids
<scanline> I should hold a poll on picogui.org to decide what piece of random text I should put into a comment in the page's HTML!
<captain_proton> ooooo
<merlin262> hmm
<darth_iBook> scanline: great idea
<ToyKeeper> Hey...  gnugo.  I should install that.

<captain_proton> darth_iBook: indeed
<darth_iBook> oki
<ToyKeeper> A go program with an attempted ai computer player.

<Xentac> scanline: I'm still thinking tasteful here...
<scanline> so, so you think you can tell
<scanline> heaven from hell
<scanline> blue skies from pain
<scanline> can you tell a green field
<scanline> from a cold steel rail
<scanline> a smile from a veil
<scanline> do you think you can tell?
<scanline> and did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
<scanline> hot ashes for trees?
<scanline> hot air for a cool breeze?
<scanline> cold comfort for change?
<scanline> and did you exchange a walk on part in the war
<scanline> for a lead role in a cage?
<scanline> how i wish

<scanline> year after year
<scanline> running over the same old ground
<scanline> what have we found?
<oogie_boogie> it's electric, boogie woogie woogie woogie
<scanline> the same old fears
<scanline> wish you were here
<scanline> and another fun one:
<scanline> Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
<scanline> You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
<scanline> Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
<scanline> Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
<scanline> Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
<scanline> You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
<scanline> And then the one day you find ten years have got behind you
<scanline> No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
<scanline> And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
<scanline> And racing around to come up behind you again
<scanline> The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
<scanline> Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
<darth_iBook> scanline: you are a monkey of unbelievable proportion
<scanline> Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
<scanline> Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
<scanline> Hanging on in quiet desparation in the English way

<Xentac> Oh, come back, proud Canadians
<Xentac> To before you had TV,
<Xentac> No hockey night in Canada,
<Xentac> There was no CBC (Oh, my God!).
<Xentac> In 1812, Madison was mad,
<Xentac> He was the president, you know
<Xentac> Well, he thought he\x{2019}d tell the British where they ought to go
<Xentac> He thought he\x{2019}d invade Canada,
<Xentac> He thought that he was tough
<Xentac> Instead we went to Washington....
<Xentac> And burned down all his stuff!
<Xentac> And the White House burned, burned, burned,
<ToyKeeper> So, is there a way to play gnugo with black/white pieces instead of X/O pieces?
<Xentac> And we\x{2019}re the one\x{2019}s that did it!
<Xentac> It burned, burned, burned,
<Xentac> While the president ran and cried.
<Xentac> It burned, burned, burned,
<Xentac> And things were very historical.
<Xentac> And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies
<Xentac> Waa waa waah!
<Xentac> In the War of 1812!
<Xentac> Now some hillbillies from Kentucky,
<scanline> you seem to have accumulated some unicode in that there text
<Xentac> Dressed in green and red,
<Xentac> Left home to fight in Canada,
<merlin262> night guys
<Xentac> But they returned home dead
<Xentac> It\x{2019}s the only war the Yankees lost, except for Vietnam
<Xentac> And also the Alamo... and the Bay of... ham.
<Xentac> The loser was America,
<Xentac> The winner was ourselves,
<Xentac> So join right in and gloat about the War of 1812
<Xentac> And the White House burned, burned, burned,
<Xentac> And we\x{2019}re the one\x{2019}s that did it!
<Xentac> It burned, burned, burned,
<Xentac> While the president ran and cried.

<Xentac> In 1812, we were just sittin\x{2019} around,
<Xentac> Mindin\x{2019} our own business, puttin\x{2019} crops into the ground.
<Xentac> We heard the soldiers coming and we didn\x{2019}t like that sound.
<Xentac> So we took a boat to Washington and burned it to the ground.
<Xentac> Oh... we... fired our guns, but the Yankees kept-a coming,
<Xentac> There wasn\x{2019}t quite as many as there was a while ago.
<Xentac> We fired once more and the Yankees started running,
<Xentac> Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, oh, oh....
<Xentac> They ran through the snow and they ran through the forest,
<Xentac> They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn\x{2019}t go.
<Xentac> They ran so fast, they forgot to take their culture,
<Xentac> Back to America, and Gulf and Texaco
<Xentac> So, if you go to Washington, its buildings

<lurgyman> hmmm

<Xentac> I can't even remember who declared war... he thinks it was you guys... but something about the message not getting to the right people...
<Xentac> cause the first three battles were won without any deaths at all...

<scanline> ahhh, much better
<ToyKeeper> Dangit.  gnugo kicks my ass on level 0.
<captain_proton> ToyKeeper: yep
<captain_proton> and i've been playing for quite a while
<ToyKeeper> At least on a 9x9 board it doesn't take very long.
<scanline> wow... gnugo's pattern database is 685kb
<captain_proton> ooo
<captain_proton> scanline: in pic assembly, does an 'x' inside a number mean not to touch a bit within a register?
<scanline> just means undefined... usually they aren't implemented in hardware, so writes have no effect and they always read as zero
<captain_proton> ohh
<captain_proton> ohh right
<captain_proton> i had heated up water
<darth_iBook> phew, I was afraid you were gone captain_proton 
<captain_proton> UUGH!
<captain_proton> the tmr0 stuff is really badly written
<scanline> huh?
<captain_proton> in the datasheet
<scanline> what part do you need help with?
<captain_proton> Timer mode is selected by clearing the T0CS bit
<captain_proton> (OPTION<5>). In timer mode, the Timer0 module will
<captain_proton> increment every instruction cycle (without prescaler). If
<captain_proton> TMR0 register is written, the increment is inhibited for
<captain_proton> the following two instruction cycles (Figure 6-2 and
<captain_proton> Figure 6-3). The user can work around this by writing
<captain_proton> an adjusted value to the TMR0 register.
<scanline> ok
<scanline> TMR0 can act as either a timer that increments at some fraction of the CPU clock, or it can count pulses on the T0CKI pin- that's what the T0CS bit selects
<scanline> the prescaler lets you adjust what fraction of the CPU clock it increments at
<scanline> the rest of that is just saying that the timer doesn't increment for the two cycles after you write to it, so you have to take that into account in your calculations
<captain_proton> ohh when -you- write to it
<captain_proton> i was thinking when the timer wrote to it
<scanline> ahh
<captain_proton> and getting really confused
<scanline> that would be strange
<darth_iBook> yay! there's still 45 mins of trading places
<scanline> when in doubt, you can see the TMR0 register increment in the simulator
<darth_iBook> and wxwindows is almost doen dl'ing
<captain_proton> without prescaler the timer tick would be 1MHz, right?
<scanline> yep
<captain_proton> i don't think that the scaler would be nearly enough then
<captain_proton> even at 1:256, thats 3.9KHz, which is a LOT faster than the refresh
<scanline> you could use the TMR0 interrupt to have a handler increment another counter
<scanline> or you could just time it manually in the loop that polls the light sensor
<scanline> that could get nasty since you'd have to make sure all your code paths were about the same length, but the interrupt would mess up your IR timing slightly
<scanline> always tradeoffs :)
<captain_proton> IR timing? huh?
<scanline> oh, right.. you won't be sending IR codes until right before shutdown
<scanline> so actually, either the interrupt or the manual timing would be pretty easy
<scanline> the interrupt would be easier
<scanline> hmm...
<scanline> in fact
<captain_proton> it would be nice if the counter ran at 512Hz
<captain_proton> then we have adequate timing for screen refreshes, and can do a single run of the timer, then poewr down
<scanline> all you'd need to do would be to have the interupt increment a counter periodically, then have a loop that sits and waits for something interesting on the IR, and uses that counter to index into a bitfield where it plops down a 1
<scanline> or if you want more resolution than a bitfield would give you in such limited memory, a list of times
<captain_proton> i was thinking a list of times
<scanline> so yeah, that should be easy
<ToyKeeper> Hmm.  I'm not getting much programming done, now that I got cgoban set up to play against gnugo.
<captain_proton> hehe
<captain_proton> yeah :P
<captain_proton> chmod a+x /usr/games/bin/*
<scanline> I didn't even have +x on /usr/games
<ToyKeeper> Was it just g+x?
<scanline> yeah
<scanline> captain_proton: whatchaneed?
<ToyKeeper> What's wrong with having a "games" group?
<captain_proton> scanline: dunno
<ToyKeeper> Maybe if I even beat gnugo, I can try playing against a real person.  :)
<captain_proton> i think i'm just too tired to really try to think this through
<ToyKeeper> s/even/ever/
<captain_proton> ToyKeeper: if you want to connect to NNGS i'll play you
<ToyKeeper> Nah, I suck waaay too much still.  :)
<ToyKeeper> I'll register on nngs sometime, if I get any better.
<captain_proton> mmmmmm
<captain_proton> scanline: the tea really is better if you brew it at a colder temperature
<ToyKeeper> Besides, I should maybe get back to useful stuff.  ;)
<scanline> how much colder?
<captain_proton> umm
<scanline> I've been microwaving, letting it cool a little, then steeping with the cup covered.. seems to be working nicely
<darth_iBook> goddammit! why is os x such a pain in the ass
<captain_proton> i usually heat it through my coffee maker, this time i let it sit for 5 minutes or so before dropping in the teabag
<scanline> I'll have to try that.. usually I only let it cool for 1 minute or so
<captain_proton> it comes out of the pot near-boiling
<scanline> same with the microwave
<captain_proton> well then
<scanline> :)
<captain_proton> its odd, green tea is about the only kind i like

<darth_iBook> scanline: what did you suggest for doing the graphics for that program?
<darth_iBook> wxwindows hates osx
<scanline> graphics what huh?
<darth_iBook> for that hangman pgm I made
<ToyKeeper> anygui?
<scanline> oh yeah
<scanline> anygui is good
<scanline> not sure if it handles canvas type drawing though
<ToyKeeper> I made one of those once.  It was called gooey.
<ToyKeeper> But anygui and wxwindows do it better.  :)
<captain_proton> once epterm is done, and perhaps the lightguns, i should do that picogui NNGS/go modem client :)
<ToyKeeper> I want a go program I can use on my zaurus..  (in x11)
<captain_proton> in x11? YOU FOOL!
<captain_proton> ahem*
<ToyKeeper> I can't stand opie.  :)
<scanline> x11 is better than qt/e...
<scanline> and it actually has software
<captain_proton> doesn't take much
<scanline> :)
<captain_proton> hmm
<captain_proton> the pens HP gave out at the internship fair are cute
<ToyKeeper> It's just hard to find x11 programs which are usable at 240x320.
<scanline> that's one of those things picogui tries to fix...
<ToyKeeper> So far, about half the stuff I use on my zaurus is stuff I wrote.
<darth_iBook> snack time
<ToyKeeper> But I'm lazy, so most of it is pygtk.
<scanline> shat sort of stuff have you written?
<captain_proton> scanline: that reflow toaster oven is cool
<scanline> indeed
<captain_proton> perhaps when we're doing usb hubs & the A/V system of doom
<scanline> ahh!
<scanline> the horizontal and vertical flip buttons in sodipodi aren't implemented, but you can give it a negative scale factor
<captain_proton> what in the world are you messing with sodipodi for?
<scanline> crystalspace needs a version of their logo that looks good on backgrounds other than slightly-bluish-black
<ToyKeeper> Hmm.  Battery meter, filemanager / playlist manager, rpn hp48-like calculator, text editor, xkbd layout, process manager, database front-end, metric clock, bookreader, movie showtimes updater, ...
<ToyKeeper> That's all I can remember right now.
<captain_proton> metric clock?
<captain_proton> that measures time in metric hours?
<ToyKeeper> Yup.
<ToyKeeper> A day lasts 000.00 to 999.99, where 500.00 is noon.
<ToyKeeper> It's 02:07, or 088 now.
<ToyKeeper> Each .01 is about 0.864s, so the smallest digit has the same purpose as a second.
<ToyKeeper> Each 001.00 is about 1m26s, giving it a similar purpose to a minute.
<captain_proton> sounds very silly to me
<ToyKeeper> An average TV show is about 20 units long.  10 units, commercial, 10 more units.
<ToyKeeper> It *is* silly.  :)
<ToyKeeper> But it amuses me.
<ToyKeeper> It actually has most of the good qualities of our current time system, plus some extras.  But of course, there's no way it could ever become widely-used in the foreseeable future.
<darth_iBook> mmmmmmmmm, food
<ToyKeeper> It's even easy to speak..   What time is it?  It's six thirty!  Except 630.00 would really be 15:08.
<ToyKeeper> Bleh.  Just one of my toys.  :0
<ToyKeeper> :), even.
<captain_proton> hmm
<captain_proton> have to wake up in 7 hours
<scanline> I did a little logo as a test, and they liked it...

<scanline> ^ same file, on two different backgrounds.. using the same technique I used for the new picogui logo
<scanline> should work nicely for logos in demos, where the background is always changing
<captain_proton> what technique is that?
<scanline> add both a white halo and a slight drop shadow
<scanline> halo on top
<scanline> looks pretty decent on any sort of background tehn
<darth_iBook> scanline: cool, I like the white one myself
<scanline> it's the same file

<file> gonkulator: so do you think I have enough?
<gonkulator> for now, yes

<gonkulator> yeah
<file> good good
<gonkulator> when I installed on my work machine, I had a 3 gig /usr a 2.4 gig /home and a 3 gig /
<gonkulator> and then a boot and swap
<gonkulator> and that has handled EVERYTHING I have thrown at it
<file> hehe
<gonkulator> thats what I love about linux
<gonkulator> its easy to make it span multiple disks like that
<file> does it delete source stuff once it's compiled/installed?
<gonkulator> all we had was a dualie 500 P3 and 3 3 gig disks
<gonkulator> it deletes the source, yes
<file> good
<gonkulator> but sometimes you have to manually clean it out
<file> mmm... stage1... optimized GCC...
<gonkulator> if you are low on disk space, you can safely delete everything in /tmp/portage/ (IIRC on that one) and /usr/portage/distfiles/
<file> uh huh
<gonkulator> maybe it is /var/tmp/

<prot-home> hm?
<gonkulator> the one we have has (somewhat) cheap pieces
<gonkulator> they are glass, but cheap
<gonkulator> and don't get captured well
<prot-home> you could just buy new stones ;)

<gonkulator> oh
<gonkulator> whats your method
<Xentac> basically it's 45 minutes study, 15 minutes break... rinse and repeat

<lurgyman> hmm...
<scanlime> prot-home: oh. this is that midterm I forgot to go to....
<prot-home> sounds like me
<scanlime> s/go to/do/
<prot-home> ^^
<prot-home> lurgyman: yupyup
<scanlime> yeah... so I'm actually (gasp) trying to find out what classes I need to take to graduate
<lurgyman> graduwhat?
<prot-home> what's a graduate?
<scanlime> also been looking for a job though.. need one for summer, and if by some chance I can find a good full time job I'll take that over finishing college
<prot-home> wacko
<scanlime> heh
<prot-home> sadly, the piece of paper is worth it
<prot-home> IMO
<lurgyman> a graduate is a person that goes around causing simon and garfunkel to blast constantly
<scanlime> a CS degree?
<scanlime> I might be able to graduate next year, depending on how much these IB credits actually count for
<prot-home> scanlime: yeah...without it, i'm just some random kid who finished high school
<lurgyman> instead of being a random kid with a cs degree
<prot-home> uhhuh
<scanlime> prot-home: and I'm a random kid who finished high school and has skill ;)
<prot-home> snort
<prot-home> also, college is a nice place to hide while the industry recovers
<scanlime> eh, that's true
<scanlime> was talking to my parents tonight.. they reminded me that I could use my other student loan that I'm currently not using to pay for rent type stuff
<scanlime> too late here... my family makes too much for me to get a scholarship, but they have too much debt to pay for college
<scanlime> CS degrees appear to be really easy to get
<scanlime> I've already taken almost all the requirements
<lurgyman> that's why its CS, not EE :(
<scanlime> I like EE type stuff, but I want it as a hobby not a job
<lurgyman> hehe
<lurgyman> yep
<scanlime> I'm decent at EEish stuff, and it's fun.. but I'm not nearly as good at it as I am at programming
<prot-home> my thinking is that the degree gets me in the door, then my work experience & skill set actually gets me the job
<lurgyman> :)
<scanlime> Methinks that I'll be looking for a job, but assuming I don't find it I'll try to actually finish this CS degree next year
<lurgyman> hmm...
<prot-home> lurgyman: elegant?
<prot-home> you're insane
<lurgyman> ooh, glissandoed alberti bass... hmm
<prot-home> off to bed for me
<lurgyman> hmm
<lurgyman> mayhaps lurgyman should go to bed as well
<scanlime> scary
<scanlime> well, I'm off to bed too

<hardwire> scanline: whats up with -5v and -12v going into motherboards?
<hardwire> and why are they -?
<scanline> hardwire: they're negative because if you measured ground relative to them you'd get a positive voltage
<scanline> it's just how negative voltage works :)
<hardwire> ok
<scanline> I don't know what modern motherboards use -5 and -12 for... old ones used them for serial ports and ethernet
<hardwire> how do I personally generate that from like a battery source?
<hardwire> oooh.. ok
<hardwire> I probably don't need them
<scanline> well, first I'd try powering the motherboard up without -5 and -12 to see if you really need them
<scanline> yeah
<scanline> and if you do, you'd need to build a DC-DC converter
<hardwire> well.. grr.. I don't like ATX power supplies

<darth_iBook> let's see if that fixed it
<file> darth_iBook: good luck
<darth_iBook> t'anks
<lurgyman> gonkulator: go?
<file> oh I also must setup Samba...
<gonkulator> lurgyman: maybe after dinner.  Like 30 minutes?
<lurgyman> if i'm around, sure
<gonkulator> okies
<darth_iBook> well, it's sorta working
<darth_iBook> but it can't find the damned ethernet card
<lurgyman> weird...
<darth_iBook> ARG!
<gonkulator> darth_iBook: cd boot?
<darth_iBook> gonkulator: what about it?
<gonkulator> that has all the net modules compiled in
<darth_iBook> is that how I should get the card working again?
<gonkulator> noooooooooooooooooooo
<gonkulator> just rmmod and insmod it
<darth_iBook> ?
<darth_iBook> the drivers for my ethernet card aren't modules, they're compiled in
<darth_iBook> w00t!
<darth_iBook> nm
<file> lol
<darth_iBook> I configured my laptop differently and compiled those in, instead of leaving them as modules
<darth_mall> ohthankgod
<darth_mall> thanks for your help guys
<gonkulator> good deal
<file> what was the problem?
<darth_mall> gonkulator was right, the fstab got messed up
<file> oh ic
<darth_mall> and, for some reason, so did modules.autoload
<lurgyman> huzzah that it got fixed!
<darth_mall> I didn't realize that gonkulator (he did this install for me) had done all these things as modules
<darth_mall> I just needed to load the modules and everything got better
<darth_mall> and they're in my autoload file now too (again)
<gonkulator> good deal
<darth_mall> I just about gave myself an aneurism there
<file> that wouldn't have been good...
<gonkulator> its ok
<darth_mall> gonkulator: thanks, you saved my butt
<gonkulator> yep
<gonkulator> it usually takes quite a lot to break a linux install on accident
<gonkulator> unlike windows :)
<gonkulator> which breaks on its own
<file> I'm sorry Dave, I can't let you do that.
<darth_mall> except for that dork who sings during the chorus, bring me to life is a great song
<gonkulator> :)
<file> I believe I'm listening to California Dreamin' by DJ Sammy right now
<darth_mall> hiya scanline
<darth_mall> lol
<file> scanline: I must thank you for introducing me to DJ Doboy's mixes
<gonkulator> PicoBot: welcome back
<PicoBot> It's great to be back!

<darth_iBook> wow, this is really not my day
<darth_iBook> anyone around wanna gimme a hand with this?
<lurgyman> what's it doing?
<darth_iBook> it's that libstdc++.so.5
<darth_iBook> says it can't find it
<darth_iBook> or doesn't have access
<darth_iBook> won't lemme emerge things, and it won't lemme start X either
<darth_iBook> it happened right after I emerged the newest version of linux-wlan-ng
<lurgyman> is there a libstdc++ anywhere in /lib
<lurgyman> and /usr/lib?
<darth_iBook> yeah
<darth_iBook> i've got 2.7 and 2.8 for some reason
<lurgyman> libstdc++.so.5?
<darth_iBook> doesn't look like it, that's somewhere else
<lurgyman> are 2.7 or 2.8 linked to libstdc++.so.5?
<darth_iBook> should I cp it here?
<lurgyman> the ls output? sure
<darth_iBook> no, they aren't linked
<darth_iBook> no
<lurgyman> okey
<darth_iBook> should I cp the libstdc++.so.5 to the /usr/lib
<lurgyman> it's in /lib right now?
<darth_iBook> it's in /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.2.2/
<lurgyman> i think that's right
<lurgyman> shouldn't need to copy
<lurgyman> and ldconfig did nothing?
<scanline> e
<darth_iBook> still nothing
<darth_iBook> cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
<lurgyman> is that the output from ldconfig?
<darth_iBook> no
<darth_iBook> to test I did "emerge search gnugo"
<lurgyman> oh
<darth_iBook> python2.2: error while loa"ding shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

<gonkulator> darth_mall: whats wrong now?
<darth_mall> I'm trying to get this damned adapter to work still
<darth_mall> it's really pissing me off
<gonkulator> stop for now
<gonkulator> instead of smashing your head against the wall, do some research on it
<darth_mall> that's what I've been doing
<darth_mall> but fucking linksys won't tell me what the damned chipset is
<gonkulator> ah
<gonkulator> have you searched forums?
<darth_mall> so I can't even tell if I've got the right drivers, but I'm pretty sure I do
<darth_mall> not yet
<gonkulator> well, I am exhausted
<gonkulator> sleepy time is upon me
<darth_mall> already?
<gonkulator> lurgyman: Hey Dan!
<gonkulator> darth_mall: yeah
<darth_mall> why can't it find this device?
<lurgyman> bedtime!
<hardwire> darth_mall: hi
<hardwire> what is the device?
<darth_mall> wireless usb adapter from linksys
<hardwire> flip it over
<hardwire> whats the version on the back
<darth_mall> 2.6
<hardwire> fuck
<hardwire> trying to get it to work under linux?
<darth_mall> yeah, why? does it not work under linux?
<hardwire> thats the atmel chipset
<hardwire> it blows ass
<hardwire> the driver works 20% of the time
<darth_mall> it's atmel?
<darth_mall> well fuck
<hardwire> yeah
<hardwire> use pcmcia if you can
<hardwire> wifi usb is a little wonky
<darth_mall> can't, already have this one
<darth_mall> don't really wanna buy a new one
<hardwire> yeah.. 
<hardwire> lemme link you a driver
<hardwire> brb
<hardwire> http://atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
<hardwire> that "sometimes" works
<hardwire> http://at76c503a.berlios.de/
<hardwire> thta one is the most promising
<hardwire> what usb chipst do you have?
<hardwire> like what is the driver you are using
<darth_mall> not sure
<hardwire> host usb chipset :)
<hardwire> cat /proc/pci
<darth_mall> u want the usb controllers right?
<captain_proton> probably UHCI
<hardwire> most of the drivers work best with uhci.o
<hardwire> instead of usb-uhci.o
<hardwire> they are all based off of the same base code for  usb routines
<hardwire> http://at76c503a.berlios.de/ <- most promising
<hardwire> like I said before you should attempt to get that one working first
<hardwire> I have a linksys 2.6.. I have a hard time getting it to work w/o kernel panicking
<hardwire> I have been crashing on the couch.. my poor roomates must think I am a goof
<darth_mall> dammit
<hardwire> dammit indeed
<darth_mall> it can't find gcc now
<hardwire> :(
<darth_mall> wtf is wrong with my computer today?
<hardwire> stuff
<darth_mall> is there a pretty pointy-clicky version of gnugo?
<lurgyman> cgoban
<darth_mall> ok, that's what that is
<captain_proton> darth_mall: use the 'go modem' button, then specify the program as '/usr/bin/gnugo --quiet'
<darth_mall> captain_proton: you lost me
<captain_proton> darth_mall: in cgoban
<darth_mall> oh, ok
<lurgyman> darth_mall: hmm... what's your path?
<darth_mall> to what? gnugo?
<lurgyman> no, in your environment
<darth_mall> oh, my search path?
<darth_mall> /home/silme/java-dev/bin/:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/3.2:/usr/X11R6/bin:/opt/sun-jdk-1.4.1.01/bin:/opt/sun-jdk-1.4.1.01/jre/bin:/usr/qt/3/bin:/usr/kde/3.1/bin
<lurgyman> hmm
<darth_mall> how do I make cgoban work?
<captain_proton> darth_mall: hm?
<darth_mall> well, cgoban is not a command and gnugo is still ASCII
<captain_proton> darth_mall: emerge cgoban
<captain_proton> its a separate program that just frontends gnugo
<darth_mall> I emerged it
<captain_proton> its in /usr/games/bin

<gonkulator> its the brownies
<captain_proton> refridgerator too warm?
<scanline> and worst of all, I noticed this while pouring it in some chai...
<scanline> it was on the second coldest setting.. assuming the "min" setting is coldest
<gonkulator> doh...
<scanline> hmm...
<captain_proton> that sucks
<scanline> the "off" setting is right next to "min" which would seem to indicate that it's the warmest setting

<scanline> bah
<captain_proton> min is the warmest
<scanline> grr...
<captain_proton> gonkulator: you probably turned it to max, which is close to off
<scanline> wow, michael's computer really doesn't sound good

<gonkulator> scanline or captain_proton:: where did you get those funny posters?

<scanline> darth_iBook: yes

<darth_iBook> scanline: can you explain to me what the channel does on my wifi network?
<scanline> and soon the Surface porting shall commence :)
<scanline> darth_iBook: it changes the radio frequency the network uses. usually the default is good
<scanline> you'd only normally change it to avoid interference, or use several networks near each other
<darth_iBook> how do you know what the default is?
<scanline> for base stations I think the default is channel 1, 802.11b cards usually default to autodetecting the channel

<scanline> my LCD flickers on and off about a dozen times, then it shows that annoying spinning ATI logo, then my CRT flickers a bunch and shows the nVidia logo
<captain_proton> last night, over 30 million brass band instruments were dropped on blackpool. there appears to be no valid reason for this operation, but it is estimated that it cost the treasury over 25 million pounds
<scanline> hmm, this leaves more room for coffee supplies
<scanline> unfortunately my gigabit ethernet seems to be nonfunctional, so for the moment I have only read-only 100baseT NFS
<lurgyman> scanline: emacs is a fantastically scriptable environment for playing tetris
<scanline> that it is
<zak> err
<scanline> nooo
<scanline> zak: get back here!
<scanline> :)
<zak> tomorrow one of you needs to show me how to change my password
<captain_proton> zak: run 'passwd' in a terminal
<lurgyman> or reinstall
<zak> ok
<lurgyman> with a different password
<zak> lurgyman: no
<scanline> hehe
<zak> captain_proton: try to access my computer now
<zak> i think i did...i hope to god i remember it, because it won't let me use the ones i usually use
<captain_proton> zak: i can log in as root still ;)
<zak> how i change that?
<captain_proton> do 'su -', type in root's password, then run passwd
<zak> i don't know root's unless it was the same
<captain_proton> its the same
<zak> try now
<captain_proton> changed
<zak> that was wierd, it seemed to think that my cats name spelt backwords with a 3 and a 1 instead of an e and an i was a dictionary word
<zak> how is r3gg1t a dictionary word?
<captain_proton> its too similar to vegetable
<scanline> hehe
<zak> bah!
<scanline> this 1280x1024 screen seems so small compared to 1600x1200
<hardwire> my navi access is broked
<hardwire> yay
<hardwire> nm
<hardwire> it works today
<scanline> woa
<scanline> any heavy graphical activity on this Mach64 screen will make my audio skip
<scanline> ugh, what a crappy video card
<hardwire> yes
<scanline> there's a little beep-click thing whenever I change focus on this screen
<captain_proton> scary
<scanline> at least it doesn't happen on my other head
<scanline> methinks until I get a better card, this screen will just be for IRC, xmms, and displaying documentation pages
<scanline> hmm.. astrology night lab later today
<captain_proton> we should go to that
<captain_proton> is there another after it?
<scanline> yes, one more
<captain_proton> good idear for you
<scanline> yup
<captain_proton> naptime
<ToyKeeper> Yay..  got another win against gnugo...  ridiculously easy skill level, though.
<ToyKeeper> I wonder if I can do it with a 2-stone handicap instead of 3...
<scanline> naptime for me too
