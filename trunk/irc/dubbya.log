<egil> the cartoon on the Al jaseerah site on the North Korean nuclear arms programme (which may well be able to reach the USA but certainly CAN hit US troops) being ignored while Saddam, wh has no nuclear arms is a "menace" are quite amusing 
<Digital_H> miguk the last thing he did was kick out inspectors, what 3 years aog.  he has made no aggressions since the gulf war ended.  
<Miguk> cries of no war for oil are ignorant
<cawt`> CapeGuy so the global terrorists will hate us. nothing will change
--- Starting response with 'change'

<dubbya> change and omani nationals remain unaccounted for women, and right now in a few minutes to expect it could be killed, along with the size of this threat and again 
<cawt`> Miguk yeah, it is
<belmont^> CapeGuy: But I disagree that we are breeding any terrorists at all...if terrorists choose to create themselves because they are upset that we want freedom and liberty....they are to blame for their own development
--- Starting response with 'development'

<dubbya> development program, had likely range of any fingerprints

<CapeGuy> cawt:  Not just ten times as many globally, but those previously on the fence and living in the US of A!
<belmont^> Digital_H: if he didnt care about the iraqi people, we would just drop a nuclear weapon and end this war today
--- Starting response with 'today'
--- Responding: 'today and monitoring the congress more than a gift to keep these sites and can coexist peacefully will be confident they can meet the people '
<dubbya> today and monitoring the congress more than a gift to keep these sites and can coexist peacefully will be confident they can meet the people 
<Miguk> freedom for the iraqi people is and should be secondary to the security of the US, but that is not to say we canna have both
--- Starting response with 'both'
--- Responding: 'both our nation in a huge country and produces chemical agents like it brings, and patients back a child credit to death sentence, many nations, even exist '
<dubbya> both our nation in a huge country and produces chemical agents like it brings, and patients back a child credit to death sentence, many nations, even exist 
<Digital_H> bullshit.  that would not be a smart political movew
<belmont^> CapeGuy: that is not our doing...we dont make them make their choices
<cawt`> CapeGuy; For the past 4 decades these global terrorists have been killing us around the world. It's now known (and verified) that doing nothing makes the problem of global terrorism worse. as evidenced by 9-11
--- Starting response with '9-11'

<dubbya> if this kind of czechoslovakia. they were in his own country

<CapeGuy> Bel:  What happens is you kill an innocent opposed to Sadman ... his/her relatives become instant enemies.
<Digital_H> they have been able to prove no link
<cawt`> CapeGuy Have you ever spoken to arab nationals living in the u.s. they've long told us that they will one day rise up amongst us and kill us. they hate us. surely you know that.
<egil> miguk i think it was Tiberius who said "let them hate me as long as they fear me"                     Caligula said "i wish they all had but one neck; i would hack it through"
<Miguk> thanks egil
<Miguk> one neck is goo
<Digital_H> cawt have you?
<Miguk> good
<belmont^> CapeGuy: so how come all of these Iraqi people who have had their family members tortured and slain at the hands of Saddam Hussein are not terrorists because of him? No one is speaking about that? and why are they not terrorizing him? it doesnt wash
--- Starting response with 'wash'
--- Responding: 'miguk no more ways that iraq '
<dubbya> miguk no more ways that iraq 
<Digital_H> you know lots of arab nationals cawt?
<cawt`> Digital_H they're in Iraq. Iraq has harbored them for decades. well-known truth. one known leader died in Baghdad not too many months ago; who's been plaguing (and killing) Israelis and Americans globally for about the past 40 yrs. lol

<dubbya> lol no later than some have i urge you for it is to confront these threats on the truth though 
<Digital_H> cawt, that
<Digital_H> that's b.s.
<CapeGuy> cawt:  I hate to tell you this, for I truly sympathise, but there was grim pleasure around the Western world on 9/11 (these countries in the USA's front line for yonks) to see the USA itself get "hit directly for once".  Sad, but true.  More coming, for the Atlantic moat doesn't work anymore.
<cawt`> Digital_H you want numbers? LOl  sure. I know arab nationals. haven't done a head-count lately, though. you'll forgive me that I pray
<belmont^> www.usafreedomcorps.gov :)

<dubbya> time when you to choose their society, and comprehensive plan that iraq's dictator accepted a scattered network of iraq and the risk is up in 1990, after iraq's weapons of al qaeda 
<Miguk> i think, in the long run, that it doesn't matter if al qaeda is linked to Iraq, terrorists are terrorists and should be hunted and killed wherever we find them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them make blackmail a high horse and coalition partners are beginning to confront will find freedom for the world community of every member of the obligations as 500 tons of liters of diplomacy '
<dubbya> them make blackmail a high horse and coalition partners are beginning to confront will find freedom for the world community of every member of the obligations as 500 tons of liters of diplomacy 
<cawt`> CapeGuy oh sure. They've been killing us globally for decades. I'm sure you've noticed as I have
<CapeGuy> cawt:  And there are many, many living and working in the USA itself whose allegiances will shift.
<belmont^> Miguk: well said my friend!!!
<Digital_H> the best they could come up with was that there were some training gorunds in northern iraq, out of saddams control, out fo sadaams control
--- Starting response with 'control'
--- Responding: 'control of naval and we will and principles, come to eliminate the united states '
<dubbya> control of naval and we will and principles, come to eliminate the united states 
<cawt`> CapeGuy I expected attacks on U.S. soil for many decades. how could anyone not? when viewing their hatred for us globally for the past FORTY years. alas!
<Miguk> well, 70 cruise missiles on terrorist camps in n. iraq canna be completely wrong, now can they
--- Starting response with 'they'
--- Responding: 'they can alter the regime's repression of our allies will not this promise, spending discipline in the emergency plan is reliant upon big foreign nationals cawt? '
<dubbya> they can alter the regime's repression of our allies will not this promise, spending discipline in the emergency plan is reliant upon big foreign nationals cawt?

<dubbya> Miguk: we work of innocent lives of promise

<cawt`> CapeGuy even some American Citizens will side with the terrorists, as is well-evidenced. no news there
--- Starting response with 'there'

<dubbya> there needs more than a new openness and unconditionally forswear, disclose, and destroyed by iraqi regime wishes peace, and protect infants at all his country

<cawt`> CapeGuy very true. everything changes. 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: oh and Disney was not greedy? John Wayne wasnt an arrogant cowboy? It is called convenient memory, my friend :)
<Miguk> be back later, love the conversation
<CapeGuy> "If sentences don't make sense, don't comment on commas ..."
<cawt`> CapeGuy aw they've thought that of us for a long time. look at what Germany did. and Japan. not 60 yrs ago. already.
<Digital_H> cawt and miguk, your idea of security is to give up freedom.  that's fucked up.   you just buy what your fed hook line and sinker. 
<CapeGuy> Bel:  Look, Wayne would rather slug it out than put a slug in you, and that was before Road Runner!
<byLL> TEHRAN (AFP) - An uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime is under way in the southern city of Basra, the main Shiite Iraqi opposition group said. "A revolt is taking place in Basra," Mohammad Hadi, spokesman of the Iran-based Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (ASRII), told AFP.

<CapeGuy> Bel:  Also, up till Elvis you could still dance touching a gal!
<egil> ..especially if you WERE a girl?
<cawt`> Digital_H I didn't say anything about any of my ideas concerning freedom. You've left me to assume that you're confusing your own thoughts with mine.
<belmont^> CapeGuy: you think its smart to fight hand to hand when you have an arsenal? I think not...and Elvis fought for this country and would have died for it...so he would have been supporting our troops :)
<egil> cawt there's a lot of that about :)
<cawt`> egil; oh yeah. it's pretty common
<belmont^> whose calling who a girl? lol
<cawt`> egil; in human attempts at communication
<belmont^> cawt`: dont assume "human"....ok? hehe
<cawt`> belmont^ LOL
<belmont^> you know we probably wouldnt argue like such cretins if there were a few more women in here :)
<egil> as Neitzche said, that main problem with human communication is the illusion that it has been achieved
<CapeGuy> Bel:  Elvis would not approve of this war, I feel ... Wayne (though a conservative in real life) had common sense, and would have gone with an extended period.
<cawt`> byLL; Yeah. that's really great. the Iraqi citizens are fighting with the UK against Saddam's brutal regime
--- Starting response with 'regime'

<dubbya> egil: bush and our country much closer to be here with inspectors, what i'm the homeland 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: here is the real point...Elvis was an act, John Wayne's persona was fiction and Walt Disney was not a nice man :)
<cawt`> egi; he's a fine one to spew wisdom. he purported that everything outside his own mind was only an illusion. he was severely depressed. he needed meds. not that I think it would've helped him any. he was just plain nuts!
<byLL> cawt`, the thing is Bazra is a Shia city and Saddam is Sunni.  There is no love between them.  It will be a magnitude more difficult when we get to Baghdad
<egil> cawt to whom are you referring? you've lost me on that one
<egil> ah... Neitzche...
<belmont^> byLL: if the soldiers in Baghdad see what is happening in Bazra...there may be a betetr chance they will turn 
<CapeGuy> They went to the Gulf to defend the Iraqi people from American-led forces, but now some of South Africa's "human shields" have returned home, traumatised by the bombings in Baghdad. "Being a human shield when they're throwing bombs won't help anybody," says one, while another has been advised to seek counselling.  (www.iol.co.za)

<cawt`> byLL; oh perhaps. I know it's Shites in the south.and kurds in the north. hey, did you read in recent months about the U.S., Spain & Uk TRYING to get those factioned groups to even sit down & talk to one another. Oh my. That's gonna be a problem. They all seem to hate each other. they wouldn't even go in the same ROOM with each other. 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: those so-called human shields needed counseling before they went to Baghdad...now they are just SHock and Awe hehe :)
<CapeGuy> Bel:  True, but we've had too many anti-American-interest bombings in ZA ... :)
<cawt`> byll; what I read in the papers is that EACH group wants to rule the new Iraq ALONE. The u.s., brits & spain told them; "oh no. you'll rule together or not at all" that's how it's gonna be. 
--- Starting response with 'be'
--- Responding: 'be subliminable sic or near '
<dubbya> be subliminable sic or near 
<cawt`> byLL; it'll be a mess trying them to sit down to the same table together, much less rule the country of Iraq together.

<dubbya> together or makes the planet in the middle east, has destroyed them to our country, they wouldn't even more, i serve 
<belmont^> CapeGuy: there should be resistence to that bombing :)
<byLL> cawt`, yes we have more problems to deal with in the future
<cawt`> byLL; oh i'm sure the u.s. will be in Iraq for an extended period. like Korea, Japan and Germany. not much doubt in my mind about that whatsoever

<dubbya> unlike the families is mobilizing against you know saddam hussein attacked and fully cooperate fully in sparing innocent civilians from any man 
<belmont^> WHat are you all going to say in a couple of years when Bush is voted out as President and we get a new President and he decides to give money to Iraq so that they can help us fight Iran? LOL
--- Starting response with 'lol'

<belmont^> whohooo :D
<belmont^> Its...Its...Hounds of the BASKERvilles!! :)
<cawt`> belmont^; well. my opinion of that (should it be the case) will depend solely on the myriad of various circumstances at that time.
<belmont^> cawt`: good answer :) you diplomat you!! wait...a diplomat! burn him!!!! ;)
<cawt`> belmont^; a bunch of think-tank guys were talking about Iraq and Iran on 9-15-01. on c-span. very interesting.
--- Starting response with 'interesting'
--- Responding: 'in 1991, the peace, it will soon '
<dubbya> in 1991, the peace, it will soon 
<belmont^> cawt`: that had to be a very dry conversation
<cawt`> belmont^ I'm not a diplomat. not at all. I was being sincere. how can I know what I'll think about something that hasen't happened yet, and may never happen at all? I'd be a darn fool to claim that I would 
<cawt`> belmont^; oh no. It was the opposite of boring or dry. It was VERY interesting indeed. 3 days after 9-11 they were talking about this war we're in right now. "saddam's got to go" they said. Asia is next. a great telescope peep into the future
<cawt`> at the time
<byLL> VATICAN CITY -- The vast antiwar movement in the world shows that a "large part of humanity" has rejected the idea of war as a means of resolving conflicts between nations, Pope John Paul II said in a message released Tuesday.
<byLL> The pope, a staunch opponent of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, sent his message to Roman Catholic military chaplains attending a Vatican-organized course on humanitarian law. He cited the "vast contemporary movement in favor of peace" around the world and said he took "comfort and hope" from the efforts for peace by various religions.

<egil> byll maybe it would be a good idea for the USa to borrow a Grand Slam out of the Imperial War Museum in london.....although they are 1,000lbs heavier than the recent MOAB bomb the US has bee promoting recently as the best game in town
<Basker> ergil -- weren't they developed for use against reinforced submarine pens??
<egil> no
<egil> they were developed for blowing the foundations out from under massive structures... the TallBoy mini-version was used against the submarine pens at St Nazaire
<egil> they went through 50 feet of reinforced concrete with NO trouble
<Basker> egil -- ok.  I was alive at the time but have not remembered all the finer details. :)
<egil> the Grand Slams were too expensive to use freely.... only 41 were used in anger
<Basker> egil -- well, we were angry. :)
<egil> true :)
<belmont^> I think once Saddah and his regime are gone, and the North Korean leadership is gone, we will begin to see fewer terrorist attacks...

<DaDuck> did i hear my name?
<Basker> MrSteve -- Sometimes quality is more satisfying than quantity.  This channel is somewhat sporadic -- for which I, as the only op around, give sincere thanks. :)
<nibbers> well i dont know are you using microsoft agent DaDuck ?
<DaDuck> nope .. but what is MS agent?
<nibbers> if not the chances of hearing your name are greatly reduced 
<nibbers> it reads text to you 
<DaDuck> oh
<nibbers> it can also be used to transfer voice to text 
<DaDuck> my mIRC client software script does signal me with a special sound when my name gets mentioned in any irc window
<Basker> Well, if you think rerading it is bad, wait till you hear it. :))

<nibbers> brb gonna go see what that is all about 
<limejuice> in another 20 years, PETA will most likely object masturbation because it's cruelty to sperm
<byLL> MARCH 25--When The Smoking Gun learned today (via a Drudge Report link) that coalition forces in Iraq had embedded sea life in the drive to oust Saddam Hussein, we wondered how long it would take People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to leap to the defense of mine-sweeping dolphins and sea lions.
--- Starting response with 'lions'
--- Responding: 'we wait, the media creation '
<dubbya> we wait, the media creation 
<byLL> "Our troops deserve the best defense possible, but PETA opposes the use of dolphins, sea lions, or any other marine mammals. The project is cruel and cannot provide a reliable defense or surveillance for our troops. 
<byLL> The Navy claims they are not putting these animals in harm's way, but they've removed these animals from their homes, relocated them to foreign waters in the Persian Gulf, and are forcing them to not only inspect the waters, but to actually swim up to potential terrorists under the water, clamp a cuff on their leg, and deploy a floating marker.

<SonicReducer> yeah... the UN should kick their ass
<ne0n> Haven't you yet recognized that there is nothing called the UN?:) It was an american tool to control the world without war and it had given it up:o)
<ne0n> there is nothing called international law or any of this anymore
<Prophyria> and its good of u to have realized this just now
<Prophyria> this's been going on from like ages ago 
<ne0n> lol...this is something known long ago but the whole world was trying to believe the lie
<ne0n> <Prophyria> Where are you from?
<Prophyria> Jordan
<ne0n> Welcome:) Egypt here
<Prophyria> so same batee`7 for both of us
<ne0n> lol..yes
<byLL> ne0n, actually the French are the ones who are destroying the UN
<ne0n> batee'7 al 7okam al 3arab 
<Prophyria> exactly 
<ne0n> byLL, how?
<Prophyria> but ur guy is hillarious hehe
<byLL> ne0n, by failing to take substantial steps to enforce UN resolutions
<ne0n> like what resolution?
<byLL> 1441
<SonicReducer> they took substantial steps
<SonicReducer> they accepted that iraq diddnt comply with 1441
--- Starting response with '1441'
--- Responding: 'among them on the league of mass death and i have an oppressive regime will work '
<dubbya> among them on the league of mass death and i have an oppressive regime will work 
<ne0n> byLL, do you think Iraq has mass destruction weapons?
--- Starting response with 'weapons'
--- Responding: 'weapons and when appropriate, they deserve the suffering to operate in our time, without fingerprints, he calls his hidden materials could be able to suspend hostilities, to live and practices terror and by his own people, have been part of america also strengthen global war against the right now '
<dubbya> weapons and when appropriate, they deserve the suffering to operate in our time, without fingerprints, he calls his hidden materials could be able to suspend hostilities, to live and practices terror and by his own people, have been part of america also strengthen global war against the right now 
<SonicReducer> and they even tabled a resolution in accordence with their interpretation of "serious consequences"
<SonicReducer> what more do you want the french to do?
<byLL> ne0n, I still wonder what they did with the stuff they had in 1998
<ne0n> 1998?
<SonicReducer> what stuff did they have in 1998?
<ne0n> ?!
<SonicReducer> the stuff was just unaccounted for in 1998
<SonicReducer> that doesnt mean they had it
<byLL> No, SonicReducer, the stuff is still unaccounted for.  They had it in 1998.  The question is what has happened to it.
<ne0n> Even if they had, doesn't the US posses the WORLD's Deadliest weapons???
<SonicReducer> unnaccounted for in 1998... still unaccounted for now
<byLL> ne0n, and the USA is getting rid of its WMD
<SonicReducer> the question remains where is it
<byLL> SonicReducer, no, they actually had it in 1998
<Prophyria> and who appointed the Us the right hand of GOd?
<SonicReducer> and their answer is still the same we destroyed it in 1991
<ne0n> LooooooooooooL, this is one of the funniest jokes I ever heard
<ne0n> there is no announced program for the US to get rid of ALL of its WMD
<ne0n> byLL, Where are you?:)
<byLL> ne0n, the USA is getting rid of all of its Chemical and Biological weapon stockpiles.  They are reducing the number of nukes.
<byLL> USA
<Prophyria> that figures
<SonicReducer> byLL: care to give me a url or something (about they had weapons inb 1998)
<Shams_5> <byLL> ne0n, the USA is getting rid of all of its Chemical and Biological weapon stockpiles. <--Oh my, in Israel you mean?
<ne0n> ok, I think USA, UK, France posses the world's deadliest weapons and they are asking others to disarm!!!!!!
<ne0n> there is no logic behind that!!!
<SonicReducer> and china
<ne0n> not to mention Israel!!!!!!!
<SonicReducer> and russia too
<SonicReducer> pakistan and india remember them
<ne0n> i was mentioning the leaders
<Shams_5> China doesn't have its troop in a dozen countries around the world. They still have a better than the yanks, or UK.
<Shams_5> better case
<byLL> Shams_5, it is a fact
<SonicReducer>  agreed
<byLL> better at what?
<ne0n> israel is up to this moment refusing to sign the treaty of limiting WMD and the US as usual (without any common sense) is using the VETO power to protect them!!! I need an explanation!
<SonicReducer> byLL: at respecting the sovreignty of other countries i guess
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, it is a fact<--FACT is that Saddam received most of his arsenal from Western countries, including US back in the 80's.
<byLL> Shams_5, actually that is partially true
<byLL> Shams_5, and Saddam recently still was getting WMD from France, Russia, and Germany
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, actually that is partially true <---So, atleast you admit there is some 'truth'? :)
<SonicReducer> not WMD... that's just conventional weps that he's not allowed
<SonicReducer> that hes getting from europe that it
<SonicReducer> s\
<byLL> ne0n, perhaps it is because Israel is surrounded by hostile nations intend on detroying the "Zinist regime?"  Is that a possibility?
<byLL> Zionist even
<ne0n> even if it isn't true this doesn't give the US the right to launch war against Iraq "in the name of peace"!!!! this is a new terminology in the world of politics: "War in the name of peace"
--- Starting response with 'peace"'
--- Responding: 'iraq "in the important question asked is hearing the last two ways '
<dubbya> iraq "in the important question asked is hearing the last two ways 
<byLL> Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself?
<Shams_5> byLL, Israel is the oppressor, the occupier, the 'hostile'. 
<ne0n> byLL, do u read history?
<byLL> ne0n, it does seem illogical on the surface.
<byLL> Again Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself?
<SonicReducer> no more right than iraq does, byLL
--- Starting response with 'byll'
--- Responding: 'it's not have a growing economy grows worse '
<dubbya> it's not have a growing economy grows worse 
<byLL> SonicReducer, what right is that 
<SonicReducer> to protect itself
<Shams_5> <byLL> Shams_5, do you think that the Zionist regime has no right to protect itself? <--It has NO right to oppress and butcher the people of Palestine, in order to become a strategic point for US domination and imperialism. 
<ne0n> Israel has always been the hostile party in the war my friend 1956, 1967, 1982!!!! not to mention the palestinians all the time
<SonicReducer> and since iraq is a sovreign nation wheras israel is just an occupation... then it has less right to?
--- Starting response with 'to'
--- Responding: 'to constitute maximum peril from developing those words '
<dubbya> to constitute maximum peril from developing those words 
<byLL> I don't see Israel involved in WMD proliferation
<byLL> ne0n, and no one is hostile to Israel?  CorrecT?
<ne0n> tell me who if u can byLL please
<Shams_5> <byLL> I don't see Israel involved in WMD proliferation<---lol, what an argument! THey only have NUKES and weaponry to wipe out the entire region!
<byLL> ne0n, it is the stated goal of many people in the world to destroy Israel.  Are they justified?
<Shams_5> <byLL> ne0n, and no one is hostile to Israel? <---Why shouldn't the oppressed by hostile to the oppressor?
<byLL> Shams_5, and no one is hostile to Israel?  CorrecT?
<byLL> Shams_5, so you think that Israel has no right to defend itself?
<ne0n> byLL, I'm speaking historical facts. Would you please do too. Don;t just speak about what people intend to do, u can't punish people because U THINK they intend to do
<Shams_5> Israel has not been 'defending' itself, it's been oppressing others, and not following UN resolutions.
<ne0n> plus, Israel's right to exist is a questioned thing
<SonicReducer> byLL: i think israel has no right to defend itself
<G> i have a question

<wilson666> you probably handle my ass pennies every day
<saggasse> indigestion?
<wilson666> how does that make you feel
<wilson666> of course i spend the pennies afterwards
<saggasse> big shit, probably.
<wilson666> yep
<wilson666> but the fact is
<fryDeg> WHY, are they showing familes of the POW's on tv?????
<saggasse> cool.
<rev0lt> Most americans have strong views about how the people of the rest of the world -- especially nonwhite people of nonwesternized nations -- should live their lives.  Yet, most americans have never stepped outside of the U.S. or even their home states, and lack understanding of other cultures and histories.
<wilson666> you probably touch something thats been in my ass almost every day
<saggasse> 'Cause we all watch.
<wilson666> i have the upper hand here
<wilson666> this is how we show the system
<SonicReducer> oh rev0lt shut up
<wilson666> with ass pennies
<SonicReducer> say something new
<saggasse> if you shat your brains, a penny would come out.

<saggasse> call that a cent.
<wilson666> 2 cent
<saggasse> disagreed.
<wilson666> so
<fryDeg> "tell us everything, or our agent in America is going to kill your little sister rachael"
<saggasse> good shitten.
<wilson666> that doesnt change the fact that your hands as been on something thats been in my ass

--- Responding: 'that that iraq electric shock, burning with social security of government program! '
<dubbya> that that iraq electric shock, burning with social security of government program! 
<saggasse> I fail to perceive the meaning...
<fryDeg> Marines confiscated over more than 200 weapons, more than 3,000 chemical suits with masks and Iraqi military uniforms in the hospital, and found a T-55 tank in the hospital compound, U.S. Central Command said. 
--- Starting response with 'said'
--- Responding: 'said in every way to human rights and capable nuclear materials '
<dubbya> said in every way to human rights and capable nuclear materials 
<saggasse> what's the panic. This is war. The 2nd WW lasted for years. What makes you think this will be different?
<wilson666> its different because my ass pennies are circulating around
<belmont^> saggasse: its a superpower against a ragtag army thats why
<saggasse> yup.
<saggasse> there's a certain probability p=0,0001
<saggasse> belmont: actually, I agree. 
<wilson666> no man
<wilson666> theres at least 11,000,000 of them out there
<saggasse> I just don't see a biological attack in the form of infected pennies making their rounds.
<wilson666> a little more than that
<wilson666> you just wait
<wilson666> hahaha
<saggasse> belmont: will still be hundreds of dead coalitionists.
<saggasse> belmont: or even thousands.
<SonicReducer> the iraqi army i think is twice that of the invaders

<dubbya> america speaks with mass murder as long captivity of mass murder even when i'm talking about black and stopped terrorist networks are designed to dominate the world now 
<saggasse> 11,000,000 pennies???
<SonicReducer> its just that the coalition had air superiority

<Gabby_Hayes> and the movie that won all those awards last Sunday, wasn't the first "Chicago" film
<KurtChicago> My Big Fat Greek Wedding... supposed to be Greektown Chicago, but filmed in??? Toronto!
<KurtChicago> well, in any case... the Oscars ceremony was sort of interesting
<Gabby_Hayes> and all of them were based on a true story
<KurtChicago> my candidate was Lords of the Ring/Two Towers
<Rayth> I agree
<KurtChicago> The Hours = boring chick flick
<KurtChicago> The Pianist = overused subject
<KurtChicago> Chicago = Musical! (A good reason to disklike it as a straight man)
<Rayth> that's not why I disslike it
<Rayth> I'v e never seen it

<Rayth> The Chinese can stop in mid air
<rev0lt> a jewish pianist survives the holocaust, and the jews actor wins an oscar
<Rayth> sounds jewish
<rev0lt> the jewish carpenter got nailed to the cross, and the world worships him as God after 2000 years
<KurtChicago> well, brody is a good actor and polanski a good director
<Rayth> sounds christian

<Ragna> I love it when they show some 6th grader protesting the war...
<Dark_W0lf> heh...
<CultureWar> most of the very small amount of protesters in Pittsburgh that were out (past tense) were the usual leftist wackos.  Nobody real was out protesting.
<Ragna> "and like war is like, bad and stuff. and like it's just wrong to go there like for whatever bush wants..."
--- Starting response with 'wants"'
--- Responding: 'like a former chief weapons '
<dubbya> like a former chief weapons 
<CultureWar> And there were plenty of counter-protesters...
<CultureWar> but now nobody is out..
<WDubya3> <back> :-)
<Dark_W0lf> I'm pro war, but really dont want to be
<Dark_W0lf> but this war is needed cause saddam is worse than Bush...
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush pulled the security council president '
<dubbya> bush pulled the security council president 
<CultureWar> I'm not "pro" war... I'm not happy that it is necessary.  But it is necessary, and I'm satisfied that we're doing what has to be done.
<WDubya3> We had about 200 protesting sat.  and maybe 4-5 anti-peace protestors on the shabby side of the street.
<Dark_W0lf> CultureWar: same here
<CultureWar> 200... oooh.... wow... I guess we'd better stop the war.
<Ragna> heh, anti-peace.
<Dark_W0lf> I'd be one of the shabby guys at this protest...
<WDubya3> That 200 is up from maybe 50 some 3 weeks ago.  
<Ragna> you think the opposite of war is peace, WDubya3?
<WDubya3> We are a smaller city in Calif.
<CultureWar> so you're saying it was really an insignificant protest then?
<Dark_W0lf> <sarcasm>wow</sarcasm>
<WDubya3> Ragna In this arena?  yup!
<Ragna> in this arena?
<CultureWar> over 70% of people in the US are supporting this action in Iraq... 200 people protesting don't even register for me...
--- Starting response with 'me'
--- Responding: 'me on terror against smallpox, and biological weapons of peace of the important job is like, bad path '
<dubbya> me on terror against smallpox, and biological weapons of peace of the important job is like, bad path 
<Dark_W0lf> they mean in california
<Ragna> so in other arenas, it would not be?
<WDubya3> yea, in this conflict?  sure!
<WDubya3> C'mon Ragna , you heard what Bush said. You are either for or against.  right?  
--- Starting response with 'right'
--- Responding: 'right thing is clear our purpose is not helping to the south depends on integrity in a policy of theirs can meet the first chapter of the people of men free nations would be unavoidable '
<dubbya> right thing is clear our purpose is not helping to the south depends on integrity in a policy of theirs can meet the first chapter of the people of men free nations would be unavoidable 
<WDubya3> heh!
<Ragna> and how do you interpret that?
<Dark_W0lf> in this conflict the opponent has chem, and bio weapons... and is insane...
<Ragna> if countries aren't for our fight on terrorism, they're for terrorists?
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists such as a new openness and kill thousands '
<dubbya> terrorists such as a new openness and kill thousands 
<WDubya3> Ragna What does Iraq have to do with terrorism?
--- Starting response with 'terrorism'
--- Responding: 'terrorism itself, it's clearly violates the middle class, i smile. i don't see it is the oppression of war is a vital to congress will make our nation needs to seek and clarity and production and troops, and designs of the united nations' inspections '
<dubbya> terrorism itself, it's clearly violates the middle class, i smile. i don't see it is the oppression of war is a vital to congress will make our nation needs to seek and clarity and production and troops, and designs of the united nations' inspections 
<CultureWar> They train and support terrorists
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists are they fully within many many? '
<dubbya> terrorists are they fully within many many? 
<Ragna> well, colin powell mentioned terrorist ties in his report to the UN council.
--- Starting response with 'council'
--- Responding: 'council have another boring, melodramatic movie that saddam hussein has gassed many iraqis surrendered to vote on the jews are beginning to hell are going on... '
<dubbya> council have another boring, melodramatic movie that saddam hussein has gassed many iraqis surrendered to vote on the jews are beginning to hell are going on... 
<WDubya3> heh! ok CuFFaway , How many of the 9/11 terrorists came from Iraq?
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq has held accountable '
<dubbya> iraq has held accountable 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: there has only BEEN one...
<CultureWar> They have a terrorist training camp at Salmon Pak (spelling?) where they have a Boeing that they use to practice taking over airplanes with
--- Starting response with 'with'
--- Responding: 'with social security in one coffee ? '
<dubbya> with social security in one coffee ? 
<WDubya3> Sheesh!  Must we revisit old news every time...
<Ragna> you seem to be confusing nationality with state sanction, WDubya3.
<CultureWar> Al Qaeda members have been in Iraq for such training
--- Starting response with 'training'
--- Responding: 'training camps in which places like this. they must not following orders such training camp at the state '
<dubbya> training camps in which places like this. they must not following orders such training camp at the state 
<Ragna> old news isn't false news.
<WDubya3> nah, Iraqis don't even like Al-Qaeda.  They oppose each other ideologies.
--- Starting response with 'ideologies'
--- Responding: 'well, the united states will set foot in the world war has learned that doesnt change of people are tortured '
<dubbya> well, the united states will set foot in the world war has learned that doesnt change of people are tortured 
<CultureWar> that didn't stop Iraq from training them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them hes going next decade to teach a smirk or juice if iraq's weapons & kill wildlife, and germany doesn't want the gulf war on tv????? '
<dubbya> them hes going next decade to teach a smirk or juice if iraq's weapons & kill wildlife, and germany doesn't want the gulf war on tv????? 
<Dark_W0lf> on another, funnier note, how about these human shields?
<Ragna> yet they're united in their hatred for the US. and by iraqis, I hope you mean the iraqi govt.
--- Starting response with 'govt'
--- Responding: 'govt to invest and it reaches people of the iraq complies w/ nuclear program was working with the worlds resources and stealing '
<dubbya> govt to invest and it reaches people of the iraq complies w/ nuclear program was working with the worlds resources and stealing 
<Dark_W0lf> how effective would these wingnuts be?
<Dark_W0lf> not at all
<Ragna> heh, have you read some of their revelatory stories, Dark_W0lf?
<WDubya3> CultureWar There are more Al-Qaeda in the US then there was in Iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq is exploring ways of weapons of the most important question you had air '
<dubbya> iraq is exploring ways of weapons of the most important question you had air 
<Ragna> how they've come back to the US realizing the error in their judgements and hoping that saddam is overthrown?
<Ragna> WDubya3> and you know this how?
<Dark_W0lf> oh cool...
<WDubya3> Ragna I read.  I'm literate.
<Ragna> plus, iraq isn't al-queda's target, the US and its allies are.
--- Starting response with 'are'
--- Responding: 'are incredibly stupid to launch war in toronto. '
<dubbya> are incredibly stupid to launch war in toronto. 
<CultureWar> WDubya3, they are here illegally... they were invited guests to Iraq to receive terrorist training
--- Starting response with 'training'
--- Responding: 'training camps in baton rouge, louisiana '
<dubbya> training camps in baton rouge, louisiana 
<Dark_W0lf> but even if they DID go to Iraq, they wouldnt be able to be identified via dental records if they wee shot by a .50 calibre...
--- Starting response with 'calibre'
--- Responding: 'pakistan and lifts up '
<dubbya> pakistan and lifts up 
<Dark_W0lf> *were
<Ragna> WDubya3> well I sure would like to know how there sources know numbers of al-queda operatives here. Or are they just assuming?
<WDubya3> CultureWar You're misinformed imo.  Saddam himself said they had and will have nothing to do with them.  They are not wanted there.  They do not agree on anything.  How much more plain can I make it to you?
<CultureWar> yeah, like I believe Saddam... he's a real trustworthy source...
<Ragna> lol
<CultureWar> He also said they had no more scuds or other missiles...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: do you believe EVERYTHING you hear from Saddam?
<Ragna> yeah really. if saddam said it, it must be truE!
<CultureWar> well what have they been firing into Kuwait the last week
<Dark_W0lf> heh exactly
<Ragna> like how they don't have the scud missiles that they fired into kuwait a few days ago.
<Dark_W0lf> no scuds... RIIIIGHT....
<Ragna> and no chemical weapons! :)
<WDubya3> Read and study what each sect believes and practices. Then maybe we can talk and you will have "some" understanding.
<Dark_W0lf> <sarrasm>No these arent scuds! Their Sducs! (scud spelled backwards)</sarcasm>
<CultureWar> what they believe is irrelevant...\
<Ragna> so if saddam is such a vigorously religious muslim, and adheres to its beliefs and practices... why the genocide?
<CultureWar> the US and UK didn't like Stalin... and Stalin didn't like the US and UK... but they helped each other in WWII...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: dont think you are an expert here...
<CultureWar> likewise Al 
<WDubya3> Iraq did not help do 9/11 and no terrorist from Iraq ever did terror in the US.  
--- Starting response with 'us'
--- Responding: 'us to a good start showing up the persian gulf, who planned the 21st century '
<dubbya> us to a good start showing up the persian gulf, who planned the 21st century 
<Fire_on_High> would any of you guys be willing to check a pic for me and see if it loads?
<CultureWar> likewise Al-Qaeda doesn't like Iraq... but that won't stop them from utilizing Iraqi terrorist training camps
--- Starting response with 'camps'
--- Responding: 'camps in ourselves alone because i worked within his own military and the region '
<dubbya> camps in ourselves alone because i worked within his own military and the region 
<Ragna> your latter may very well be true, but you have no way of verifying the previous one.
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf I kinda stopped talking to you because of your insults. 
<WDubya3> oh well...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: I insulted you ONCE...
<Dark_W0lf> ever heard of sledging?
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf I learn quick!  Sometimes once is enough. :-)
<gabbo5555> How is the killing going?
<Dark_W0lf> well from what I've seen, you havent learned much...
<WDubya3> Hi gabbo5555 :-)
<gabbo5555> Hi
<CultureWar> gabbo, we'll know as soon as Baghdad falls
<CultureWar> Well, I'm off to elsewhere...
<CultureWar> on to Baghdad
<CuFFaway> saddam has wired all of his bridges with explosives
<Ragna> yeah he'd do that.
<CuFFaway> mmhmm
<Dark_W0lf> too bad HE didnt do it...
<WDubya3> CuFFaway Smart!  :-) 
<Dark_W0lf> his troops did...
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: yes...
<CuFFaway> un der his order
<gabbo5555> Is there any American who believes the excuses of the US government for this war?
<Dark_W0lf> a smart thing to do
<CuFFaway> a despewrate thing to do
<CuFFaway> -w
<Ragna> is there a war, gabbo5555?
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 There are some here who claim they do.  Don't look at me.  I see right through Bush's lies.
--- Starting response with 'lies'
--- Responding: 'in one american families is not only has a severe and uk... but not evil, then not on the security council resolution setting obstacles against terror '
<dubbya> in one american families is not only has a severe and uk... but not evil, then not on the security council resolution setting obstacles against terror 
<Dark_W0lf> and I see right through your ignorance of other's comments, WDubya3...
<gabbo5555> Ragna, ask the iraquis... they're the ones being attacked, they'll know better. Americans at their homes dont know what a war is
--- Starting response with 'is'
--- Responding: 'is from place more worried about me a year which they did a totalitarian state sanction, wdubya3. and documentation of cynicism and when you know, the help the reason we are winning '
<dubbya> is from place more worried about me a year which they did a totalitarian state sanction, wdubya3. and documentation of cynicism and when you know, the help the reason we are winning 
<CuFFaway> we learned on 9-11
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf All you do is insult. You can't win any debate or argument that way.  heh!  Try bringing some "facts" to the dialog.
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: think world war II...
<Ragna> omfg wats an iraqi lolololr?!?!11
--- Starting response with 'lolololr11'
--- Responding: 'and weaken our own '
<dubbya> and weaken our own 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: i've only been insulting YOU, because you leave yourself wide open to ANYBODY sledging you....
<WDubya3> The only fear is fear itself.  
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf Well I'm doing fine, How about you?  :-) 
<Ragna> odd how you quote someone who stood up for his ideals despite the economic and civilian costs.
<Dark_W0lf> about what?
<WDubya3> Kinda like me! :-) 
<Ragna> and bush
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush or will veto power '
<dubbya> bush or will veto power 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: you just havent noticed the others insulting you... I'm just good at intimidating people apparenlty
<Ragna> so you and bush are really alike, WDubya3! :)
--- Starting response with ':)'
--- Responding: 'the ambitions and under the job is another threat, from enablers to others, and greatest fear itself. '
<dubbya> the ambitions and under the job is another threat, from enablers to others, and greatest fear itself. 
<WDubya3> Ragna Not at all.  I never went AWOL and was never caught DUI.  :-)  Other then that well I am a male.  That is the extent of the similarities.
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: and that means WHAT to me?
<Ragna> but you just said you stand up for your ideals despite economic and civilians costs.
<Ragna> so obviously it goes past just sexual similarity.
<WDubya3> Ragna No, I never said that , you did.  :-)  
<Dark_W0lf> a person could be i a mental institute, and yet if they got elected, could STILL run a country...
<Dark_W0lf> *in
<Ragna> what was the "kinda like me! :-)" directed to?
<WDubya3> Ragna I do stand up for my ideals though. One of them is not attacking others who have not attacked me. :-)  That is easy to stand against even if alone. 
<WDubya3> imo.
<WDubya3> The attackers always leave. Perhaps low morale.  :-)
<Dark_W0lf> not always...
<CuFFaway> i spose waiting until he launches a biological attack is one option, well other than the fact that youd be dead
<Dark_W0lf> sometimes the attackers stay for the view...
<Dark_W0lf> CuFFaway: right on...
<Dark_W0lf> I'd rather minimise a threat, rather than try and deal with the threat later...
<WDubya3> CuFFaway That is just fear talking.  Any one of some 100 nations could do that.  
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: true, but only ONE country has Treatened it...
<Dark_W0lf> *threatened
<WDubya3> um.. N. Korea?
<CuFFaway> any one of a hundred nations havent had saddam hussein controlling their every breath for 34 long yrs
<gabbo5555> Eisenhower once said that "preventive attacks" were invented by Hitler
<Dark_W0lf> ok stand corrected... N. Korea also
<Dark_W0lf> but that's only 2 in 100...
<WDubya3> um... USSR during the missle crisis?
<CuFFaway> walking around with your head up your ass all the time must be boring
<WDubya3> Um... Cuba?
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: that's not NOW is it?
<CuFFaway> brb coffee
<WDubya3> um... China even at one time? 
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: that is the past
<WDubya3> all alone...
<WDubya3> :-) 
<Dark_W0lf> right now, TWO countries are ...
<WDubya3> brb
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: are you forgetting the allied forces of WWII? 
<Dark_W0lf> They're still around...
<Dark_W0lf> some have given up, and others have raised their hands in taking out saddam...
<Dark_W0lf> fear has an new meaning now, and it's called Chemical and Biological weapons of mass destruction...
<WordProcessor> o_O
<WordProcessor> UMM
<WDubya3> back :-)
<gabbo5555> 1984
<WDubya3> Dark_W0lf Go back to insults.  You were better there. :-)
<CuFFaway> would you wait until a guy with a baseball bat swung it at your wifes head before reacting? afterall, just because he has it raised above his head is no proof he will actually use it
<Dark_W0lf> but the threat is there...
<gabbo5555> lol cuFFaway
<gabbo5555> you're nuts
<Dark_W0lf> no he's got a point there...
<CuFFaway> im notta he and namecalling is not a very effective way to communicate
<WDubya3> Hi WP
<Dark_W0lf> CuFFaway: you directing that namecalling at me? or some other?
<CuFFaway> gabbo
<Dark_W0lf> oh
<Dark_W0lf> ok just off the subject here, who thinks I'm annoying?
<WDubya3> CuFFaway Would you use a nuke on the guy?
<CuFFaway> i dont
<WDubya3> heh!
<CuFFaway> only if I had to
<WDubya3> :-)
<Dark_W0lf> WDubya3: we havent actually USED a nuke yet...
<gabbo5555> Weapons of mass destruction are nothing new. Countries have had them for many years. China, Russia, Pakistan, India... Why dont you attack them? Those regimes are even worse than Iraq's regime. Better hit them first
--- Starting response with 'first'
--- Responding: 'first time debating it '
<dubbya> first time debating it 
<Dark_W0lf> well not that I know of..
<CuFFaway> no excuse
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: Saddam is from Iraq, and is THREATENING the WORLD...
--- Starting response with 'world'
--- Responding: 'world must leave iraq w/ un der his nuclear weapon '
<dubbya> world must leave iraq w/ un der his nuclear weapon 
<Dark_W0lf> the other's ARENT...
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 Of course they have.  Many nations have Gas, and all kinds of stuff. 
<gabbo5555> lol
<CuFFaway> if you dont stand up to terrorists they will take your life
--- Starting response with 'life'
--- Responding: 'life is not say that a nuclear program weapons of our commitment by failing to others, even at iran is going out friendship, ambition, moral cause, and capable of those weapons, even their faces an enemy '
<dubbya> life is not say that a nuclear program weapons of our commitment by failing to others, even at iran is going out friendship, ambition, moral cause, and capable of those weapons, even their faces an enemy 
<gabbo5555> You're the most brainwashed suckers I have seen in my life
<CuFFaway> hah
<CuFFaway> you have any mirrors in your house?
<gabbo5555> you will swallow everything your government says. Are you 10 years old?
<Dark_W0lf> gabbo5555: I HATE the government
<Dark_W0lf> but if there WAS no government, who's to say we would be better off?
<gabbo5555> now, that makes sense. Americans hate government but when it comes to attack some third world ass they love government
<WDubya3> gabbo5555 They only know the Bush line.  You see they fear, not unlike Bush.   They need to believe the US can have freedom and do whatever it wants without any responcibility for it and w/o any dialog between nations.
--- Starting response with 'nations'
--- Responding: 'nations was liberated... at risk we are afraid of the us on prescription drugs '
<dubbya> nations was liberated... at risk we are afraid of the us on prescription drugs 
<CuFFaway> all i can say is thank fuckin gawd gore isnt president or we'd be constantly recounting scuds
<CuFFaway> the terrorists wanted our attention and now they have it... whine whine whine

<WDubya3> Trickle down, or supply side, or voodoo economics does not work in any long term.  It concentrates the wealth and takes the middle classes down.  And Bush's tax cut for the rich is the same deal.  You need to get the money to the people who will spend it and invest it the fastest. That is not the rich.  That is the middle class.  That is what jumpstarts an economy.
--- Starting response with 'economy'
--- Responding: 'economy out with life on the us. '
<dubbya> economy out with life on the us. 
<asilisa> the rich pay taxes too
<WDubya3> $100 will not help me.  Bha!
<asilisa> you want a free ride on the back of rich ppl
<asilisa> typical
<WDubya3> I am not poor. I am upper-middle class.
<asilisa> punish the rich
<WDubya3> I don't envy the rich. 
<WDubya3> I also don't bark about my taxes and I pay a lot of them.
<asilisa> i dont think the rich bark either and they pay more
<Karlos^> yeah
<Karlos^> after all it's our responsibilities 
<asilisa> why dont sum of those rich ass celebrities who have 5 mansions chip in
<Karlos^> just do it 
<WDubya3> They don't pay what they should and they don't deserve a huge tax refund disproportionant to the middle and poor.  
<asilisa> i dont think they got anything disproportionate
<asilisa> thats what you would like
<WDubya3> And if you call this a stimulus package you wont stimulate the economy by giving the rich money. 
<asilisa> u pay more you get back more
<Karlos^> well the rich stimulates the economy by spending a lot 
<Karlos^> isnt it 
<WDubya3> Stimulus happens best and biggest in the middle of the road worker. The middle class.
<asilisa> so you want to punish the rich
<WDubya3> The rich do not spend the money.
<asilisa> for being rich
<asilisa> your logic is not sound
<asilisa> brb
<WDubya3> They will throw it in gold or savings durring a bad economy.  Where do you get this stuff?
<WDubya3> To stimulate an economy the money has to be moving through the economy, not sitting in a swiss bank.
<asilisa> its their money.. would u like to tell them how to spend it?
<WDubya3> It's the Govt's money. 
<asilisa> bullshit
<WDubya3> And yes!  I want the Govt to spend stimulus money on stimulus.
<asilisa> you want a free ride on the back of ppl who worked to be rich
<WDubya3> not padding the bank account of the wealthy.  How will that help any economy?
<asilisa> you want to reap the rewards of their success
<WDubya3> It's a economic stimulus pakage. That what it is for.  Hello?
<WDubya3> I'm already a success.

<asilisa> thats why 911 happened
<asilisa> its just like the animal kingdom.. the injured animal is the one that gets eaten by its peers
<Quickshot> I don't understand the terrorist point.  Next to the WTC, I've yet to see another major attack.  It's not like it's very common.
--- Starting response with 'common'
--- Responding: 'common security of his regime has conquered a matter of a terrible threats were receiving the peace, it is dressing his bowels out. i don't see large number of international law btw. '
<dubbya> common security of his regime has conquered a matter of a terrible threats were receiving the peace, it is dressing his bowels out. i don't see large number of international law btw. 
<asilisa> many many attacks have been averted
<asilisa> did you think we shud sit there and wait for the next attack?
<WDubya3> Quickshot 3000 odd people and a 4 billion dollar building, not to mention the billions in homeland crap and the pentagon.  I'd say they can rest a while.
<Quickshot> hmmm, I figure the US wouldn't get attacked if it was more careful in it's political statements.
<asilisa> hah
<asilisa> care to elaborate?
<WDubya3> How long does it take for Israel to lose 3000 people to terror?
--- Starting response with 'terror'
--- Responding: 'terror is going to buy highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for murder '
<dubbya> terror is going to buy highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for murder 
<WDubya3> years?
<asilisa> it wont happen because israel responds... they are not weak they are small
<Quickshot> hmm, well to put it in another terms, next to internal terrorist activities. I've yet to hear most other major nations having much trouble over terrorism. Why?  I figure because most don't actively meddle so much with other nations interests.
--- Starting response with 'interests'
--- Responding: 'interests and kuwait and defining moment '
<dubbya> interests and kuwait and defining moment 
<asilisa> you must not watch the news much
<Quickshot> was that last comment to me?
<asilisa> mmhmm
<WDubya3> yea Quickshot , I mean all the hate focus is on the US.  They are busy planning dirty tricks for us. 
<asilisa> the us doesnt hide behind the skirts of women and beds of sick ppl
<Quickshot> well that's just a guess of yours. I've not seen much evidence for it in real actions being under taken against the US.
<asilisa> saddams the tricky one
<Quickshot> and that's true, the US is agressive in it's political statements. But you reap what you sow ofcourse.
<WDubya3> asilisa needs to get a world view some year. heh!
<asilisa> the world view is 47 nations in the coalition supporting the effort
<WDubya3> yea Quickshot , That's true
<asilisa> yeah how dare we complain outloud when the world trade center came down.. what were we thinking
<WDubya3> complain = war.  heh!
<WDubya3> understated a bit. 
<asilisa> war = saddams refusal to abide by 1440
<asilisa> the world said disarm
<asilisa> he didnt
<Quickshot> umm, that's not a true argument, the WTC got attacked because of agressive political stances over matters concerning muslim nations.
<asilisa> bullshit
<Quickshot> ofcourse this isn't an excuse for them to attack either, anyone silly enough to do that should suffer the consequences as well.
<asilisa> the wtc got attacked because terrorists are cowards
--- Starting response with 'cowards'
--- Responding: 'i was then claim the facts lead a world '
<dubbya> i was then claim the facts lead a world 
<WDubya3> Quickshot yup! The very same reason we had 9/11 is being created again by this war.  So we all know who to thank.  Thank you Mr. idiot and the Cons.
<asilisa> why didnt they attack the forces already in their region? instead they blew up civilians.. many civilians who got up, went to work and died 
<asilisa> cowards
<Quickshot> oh that could be true I guess.  It is pretty cowardly to go after civilian targets.
<asilisa> thats exactly what the terrorists want you to feel.. fear of reprisal
--- Starting response with 'reprisal'
--- Responding: 'yes...they could detract from the homeland security, and by aljazeera feed '
<dubbya> yes...they could detract from the homeland security, and by aljazeera feed 
<asilisa> fear is how saddam has remained in power.. he knows how to dish it out, lets see if he can take it
<Quickshot> I'm sure he can actually.
<WDubya3> I fear nothing.  And I have patience.  I don't fear what Bush has a knee jerk reaction to.  Yet Saddam is such a threat that in these 12 years w/o inspections Saddam did what? Oh yea, nothing...
--- Starting response with 'nothing'
--- Responding: 'nothing can get more plain can know how much power of the resolve is clear our commitment to cease persecution of every life and allies at this promise, spending discipline in a just months for. they will accept that ... '
<dubbya> nothing can get more plain can know how much power of the resolve is clear our commitment to cease persecution of every life and allies at this promise, spending discipline in a just months for. they will accept that ... 
<Quickshot> you don't stay dictator for so long without being able to stand fear.
<WDubya3> Hey Basker 
<asilisa> yeah saddam can take it.. can his ppl take it?
<Basker> Morning all :))
<Quickshot> well I've always wondered if saddam might have financed 9/11
<asilisa> thats the difference between leadership and tyranny
<asilisa> morning basker
<WDubya3> Quickshot I wonder if Bush did.
--- Starting response with 'did'
--- Responding: 'did they gave saddam hussein's actions killed or any signs of our nation finds hope, where wings take '
<dubbya> did they gave saddam hussein's actions killed or any signs of our nation finds hope, where wings take 
<WDubya3> heh!
<PhatEmu> Byrd quoted from a letter of then-Representative Abraham Lincoln, who warned: "Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion... and you allow him to make war at pleasure. The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, prete
<asilisa> theres a ridiculous statement
<asilisa> ...<WDubya3> Quickshot I wonder if Bush did.
--- Starting response with 'did'
--- Responding: 'did nothing to achieve it? '
<dubbya> did nothing to achieve it? 
<Quickshot> indeed.
<WDubya3> Oh , but 9/11 has been so darn good for Bush. 
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush is crucial step the ages ago '
<dubbya> bush is crucial step the ages ago 
<asilisa> throw in another tangent when you fear seeing reason.. run away and hide from it
<WDubya3> W/o 9/11 Bush might have to focus on domestic policy.
--- Starting response with 'policy'
--- Responding: 'policy of the highways on integrity in the use of history anymore? '
<dubbya> policy of the highways on integrity in the use of history anymore? 
<Quickshot> WDubya3: Your argument is flawed, because if you got caught it would be the end of you.  To high a risk.
<asilisa> what for? we would be too busy watching americans die in terrorists attacks to reap the rewards of his hard work
--- Starting response with 'work'
--- Responding: 'work and al qaeda leader torture and biological weapons, saddam hussein had an urgent duty falls to a dangerous weapons '
<dubbya> work and al qaeda leader torture and biological weapons, saddam hussein had an urgent duty falls to a dangerous weapons 
<WDubya3> Quickshot If you have that kind of power an influence would your chance of getting caught be high or low?
<Quickshot> WDubya3: Very high, because more people watch your actions.
<asilisa> exactly
<WDubya3> heh!  Quickshot Have you ever heard of a proxy?
<WDubya3> People get paid to do nasty stuff every day.
<Quickshot> so what.
<Quickshot> it's not like the US is the only nation to do the watching at bush.
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush or a world of deceit and i think we don't realize how dare we are you?:) '
<dubbya> bush or a world of deceit and i think we don't realize how dare we are you?:) 
<PhatEmu> coalition will be gassed - coalition will respond with small nuke
<WDubya3> Even the CIA do nasty illegal stuff abroad and here at home.
<WDubya3> There was an old joke.  You workd for the CIA? You want to die?  heh!
<asilisa> unno what i think is gonna do saddam in? that ridiculous speech he made calling his ppl to arms.. he must think they dont have eyes or brains.. they see what he does and has been doing for 34 yrs yet blatantly pretends he's innocent to the very ppl he has starved
<asilisa> i think that prolly pissed a few of them off
<Quickshot> maybe, maybe not. It's hard to fathom irak's people ideas.
<asilisa> inno thats because they are so suppressed.. if you grew up living like that its all you would know, but they know pain and they know suffering
<asilisa> and when they cant provide their families with the basic essentials of life its an eye opener.. theyre crazed with thirst and hunger
<Quickshot> that's an assumption. I got the impression irak's people wern't that bad off.
<asilisa> and i think they will rise
<PhatEmu> can the americans live with nuking baghdad?
<WDubya3> Who cares about Saddam?  Anyone here vote for Saddam or against Saddam?  I voted for a US president and that is my duty.  I didn't vote for an idiot like Bush.  Saddams done me or the US little harm.  Bush on the other hand has done great harm to the US. 
--- Starting response with 'us'
--- Responding: 'us was required for the iraqi military importance to realize how do u just playing with this issue doesn't use innocent and the terrorists and we will return stolen property, accept no peace proposal '
<dubbya> us was required for the iraqi military importance to realize how do u just playing with this issue doesn't use innocent and the terrorists and we will return stolen property, accept no peace proposal 
<asilisa> oh ya gores not an idiot
<asilisa> saddam won his election by 100% fear
<asilisa> thats a red flag folks
<Quickshot> hmm, on to other matters. I'm wondering what a more democratic irak would make for a differance in the persian gulf region.
<WDubya3> asilisa When are you going to war? Sounds like china should be next under your thinking.
<WDubya3> heh!
<asilisa> you dont really know my thinking
<WDubya3> sure I do, what little there is. 
<asilisa> nice
<asilisa> resort to insults
<WDubya3> you have been speaking it here for hours.
<Quickshot> sigh, more retoric.
<asilisa> are you now an authority on my thinking?
<asilisa> by what standard?
<WDubya3> heh!
<WDubya3> heh!
<asilisa> okay i guess we are dun for now... see yall later
<WDubya3> Have a better one.
<Quickshot> anyone here have some more solid evidence on matters, like the way saddam mains position?
<Quickshot> see you.
<Quickshot> hm?
<asilisaway> byeeeee
<WDubya3> main position?
<Quickshot> hmmm?
<PhatEmu> america is an occupied nation
<PhatEmu> occupied by a dictatorial regime
<Quickshot> I don't see how you could in any reasonable way define that it is.
<PhatEmu> bush was not elected he was appointed by the supreme court
--- Starting response with 'court'
--- Responding: 'and i want you a goal '
<dubbya> and i want you a goal 
<Quickshot> that's rather non sensical. He still got near to 50% of the votes from the people.
<PhatEmu> bush is in violation of his oth of office and the constitution on several fronts
--- Starting response with 'fronts'
--- Responding: 'during the world has much less developed mobile biological agents like this. we use wmds and the hope that the us, we will soon '
<dubbya> during the world has much less developed mobile biological agents like this. we use wmds and the hope that the us, we will soon 
<Quickshot> and the system doesn't seem to have any unusual errors.
<Quickshot> being inn violation has little to do with getting legally into office though.
<PhatEmu> american people are permitting bush to wage an illegal war without congressional approval by a war powers act
--- Starting response with 'act'
--- Responding: 'act against his holidays in guantamala bay and wait for the peace, and hope against saddam? i would expect of mass destruction '
<dubbya> act against his holidays in guantamala bay and wait for the peace, and hope against saddam? i would expect of mass destruction 
<WDubya3> heh! You wouldn't call a president winning by appointment of a court an error?
<WDubya3> I guess not. 
<PhatEmu> no connection between his brother being the governor of the state that had all the errors huh
<Quickshot> since when have wars become illegal?  
<Quickshot> though I figure no congressional approval is less good.
<PhatEmu> since they are not on the approval of the congress and united nations
<PhatEmu> we are in violation of iternational law and constitutional law - but, that's no biggie right?
<WDubya3> The Supreme court tainted the election. They could have said, "Hey, we refuse to hear this case."  Or they could have said, "Hey you go count the ballots." , but instead they stuck their partisen nose where it never belonged.
<Quickshot> well the UN is a bit weak you know. Though it's best to try and get more formal approvement of such things from the UN.
<PhatEmu> best? no, actually it the duty of american government, they are signatories - bound by a contract
<WDubya3> They made a divided decission on undivided power.
<Quickshot> well the people of the US should make sure that the goverment stys compliant to it's own laws.
<PhatEmu> indeed quickshot, and the american people are mute if not simply ignorant and lazy
<WDubya3> The ballots never mattered after the SC got hold of it. 350 million people's wishes never mattered.
<Quickshot> that's an assumption WDubya3
<WDubya3> Quickshot No it's not. The ballots were entered in the evidence.  They were never even browsed.
<WDubya3> Never even looked at one of them.
<Quickshot> WDubya3: It still makes it an assumption.  You havn't showed which laws matter most for the supreme court. or if they did it on personal interest.
<PhatEmu> america has been sold out by it's evil politicians
<WDubya3> How about we have murder trials, but the judge never looks at your DNA evidence. he just says, well... I don't have to look at that evidence or consider it at all?
<Quickshot> and?  That more suggests there might be a problem with your justice service.
<WDubya3> The court entered the ballots as evidence.  They could have refused to allow it. they did not do that. They allowed it because it was legally entered, but they refused to look at the evidence legally entered.
<Quickshot> I have no idea how US justice works. I can't comment on that.
<glassman> Quickshot, watch LA Law
<WDubya3> Well they concluded after Bush stall tactics that the SC did not have the time to look at all the ballots.
--- Starting response with 'ballots'
--- Responding: 'ballots were right thing, and that's a scattered network was raised legitimate questions about getting from bitter division in a terrorist networks are fantastic role of our time there are not last chapter of four with medicare '
<dubbya> ballots were right thing, and that's a scattered network was raised legitimate questions about getting from bitter division in a terrorist networks are fantastic role of our time there are not last chapter of four with medicare 
<Quickshot> never seen LA Law anywhere.
<WDubya3> That that would make a late president.
<glassman> are u aussie Quickshot?
<WDubya3> I'm not bitter, I'm just trying to recount the facts.
<WDubya3> hey it's done. heh!
<Quickshot> heh, hardly. EU.
<glassman> and some people claim that malaysian elections are not whatchamaccallit?
<glassman> are we heading for a split here?
<Quickshot> split?
<glassman> its too quiet
<Quickshot> ohhh.
<Quickshot> it's usually much more busy here?
<WDubya3> I'll be bok. Peace!  
<glassman> It is hard not to conclude that the president is ignorant, the secretary of defense nuts and the secretary of state incompetent
<Quickshot> that's true.
<glassman> most of them are in undernet's political
<Quickshot> kind of makes me glad I'm living in the EU.  there much more sane at the moment.
<PhatEmu> glassman and with this diagnoses what shall we do?
<glassman> - Noted historian and essayist Richard Reeves got both applause and catcalls for this stinging rebuke, delivered during the question and answer period of a Town Hall Today lecture held in Sarasota, Florida. But he got stunned silence and walk-outs galore when he predicted that Preznit Dubya would likely be assassinated over his recent decision to attack Iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq within the 11th, saddam hussein's links to have a method of kuwait, and other equipment needed to keep good for iraq within many of coalition members. '
<dubbya> iraq within the 11th, saddam hussein's links to have a method of kuwait, and other equipment needed to keep good for iraq within many of coalition members. 
<Quickshot> hmmm.
<PhatEmu> glassman, reeves has it all wrong
<glassman> kuwait was once iraq territory, but the brits secceded it to some sheikhs under their influence
--- Starting response with 'influence'
--- Responding: 'influence would likely maintains stockpiles of nations in opportunity to serve our government for the usa is for you teach a permanent rights of the chinese died under the oppressor? '
<dubbya> influence would likely maintains stockpiles of nations in opportunity to serve our government for the usa is for you teach a permanent rights of the chinese died under the oppressor? 
<PhatEmu> dubya represents the "establishment" no matter the gravity of his inhumanity, he's "made"; it's folks that aren't part of the establishment, the pioneers, that get capped 
<glassman> bush is gonna ask congress for ,, what was it,, 80 billion or 800 billion to cover the war..,, very smart
--- Starting response with 'smart'
--- Responding: 'smart enough to do nasty illegal activities '
<dubbya> smart enough to do nasty illegal activities 
<PhatEmu> he's not getting anymore $ from me!
<glassman> and I heard a US general saying that they needed only 25 million to get rid of terrorrist in south phillines
--- Starting response with 'phillines'
--- Responding: 'call it is cretaed .. not doesn't give strength '
<dubbya> call it is cretaed .. not doesn't give strength 
<PhatEmu> let them raise funds from cocaine sales
<PhatEmu> call it iraq-contra
--- Starting response with 'iraq-contra'
--- Responding: 'lol...this is not so are days that use them '
<dubbya> lol...this is not so are days that use them 
<glassman> If the US President is attacking Iraq because he ignored U.N. sanctions, why is he blowing off the U.N. procedure and attacking Iraq in spite of the express wishes of the U.N. members? 
--- Starting response with 'members'
--- Responding: 'members of a lot of power and nuclear weapons to meet the money is irrelevant...\ '
<dubbya> members of a lot of power and nuclear weapons to meet the money is irrelevant...\ 
<PhatEmu> because he is an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick
<glassman> For a country that is all about Constitutional rights, there sure are a LOT of people who can't stand to see folks express an opinion that is contrary to their own. Makes me wonder exactly how we could induce the production of a brain stem?
<PhatEmu> agreed glassman
<Quickshot> well he certaintly didn't give the UN inspectors much time to finish there work.
<PhatEmu> might makes right
<Quickshot> on the positive side, he did get them back in iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq has nuthin like i heard it '
<dubbya> iraq has nuthin like i heard it 
<glassman> do ya think theres gona be another election in 2004? or will dubya be impeach b4 then
<PhatEmu> all 300K of them huh?
<PhatEmu> :)
<atreyou> essex friks?
<Quickshot> even if iraq has nothing, it is fairing war in breach of the geneve convention. So saddam is a quite nasty person.
--- Starting response with 'person'
--- Responding: 'person between saddam hussein's ability to know a nuclear weapons program prior to chemical and all of the first time '
<dubbya> person between saddam hussein's ability to know a nuclear weapons program prior to chemical and all of the first time 
<PhatEmu> american people don't have the testicular fortitude to impeach a rogue resident of the white house - they're all too friggin chicken shit
<PhatEmu> if iraq had nukes, we wouldn't be warring against them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them out of the apparatus of the opportunity to encourage acts of your liberation '
<dubbya> them out of the apparatus of the opportunity to encourage acts of your liberation 
<glassman> Quickshot, the Gneva Convention is a UN resolution,, the war is not
<Quickshot> ummm, I believe the rules of war was before the UN.  But nevermind.
<PhatEmu> but we can be assured that saddam himself has a nuke as a last resort - all soldiers carry backups
<Quickshot> hmmm?
<glassman> if he hadda nuke and he is as crazy as they say he is, israel is already of the map long ago
<glassman> PhatEmu
<PhatEmu> indeed, so why are americans and iraqi dying in this war?
--- Starting response with 'war'
--- Responding: 'war in the us bring destruction '
<dubbya> war in the us bring destruction 
<glassman> I think there are more british casualties
<glassman> shot by US 
<Quickshot> heh.
<Quickshot> that and flying into each other.
<PhatEmu> swell
<glassman> hello  |Chuck||
<|Chuck||> 'Owdy, glassman
<|Chuck||> 'Sup?
<glassman> I am in malaysia  |Chuck||
<|Chuck||> You have my empathy
<glassman> and malaysia is the true fundamental islamic nation
<|Chuck||> The point being?
<glassman> al qaeda and the rest are idiots
<|Chuck||> Agreed, I have no use for those who would distort and pervert ANY of the world's great religions.
<Quickshot> well that's the hobby of all extremists and fundamentalists.
<|Chuck||> Again, agreed!
<|Chuck||> Did you folks hear what happened in Basrah?
<|Chuck||> The Shi'ites hit the fan!
<PhatEmu> dats a goot wun
<|Chuck||> Did you hear France has prohibited Euro_Disney from any further fireworks shows?
<Quickshot> you know, without all the oil, the fundamentalists would find it much harder to find funding.
<Kanok> hi
<Quickshot> ehh.., why did they do that?
<|Chuck||> Great point, Quickshot
<|Chuck||> They got tired of their troops surrendering every night.
<|Chuck||> Hi Kanok
<glassman> Quickshot,, u r twisting the word fundamentalist
<|Chuck||> Bye Knaok
<Quickshot> hmmm, a bit I guess.
<|Chuck||> More correct term would be Islamists.
<Quickshot> let's see a fundamentalist are people who take the book of there religion as the exact truth, not?
<glassman> we call them deviatinist
<|Chuck||> So sayeth many of the moderate Imams.
<glassman> we call them deviationist
<Kanok> re
<|Chuck||> re's
<glassman> fundamentalist are ones who take basis of their religion and practice it
<Quickshot> hmmm, well I know about fundamentalist christians, they are rather literal over the christian books.  Which isn't really very wise.
<|Chuck||> Actually, being a fundmentalist for any religion isn't bad, when t turns sour is when it's practitioners begin forcing their views on others.
<glassman> but Christian on trhe other hand are reading man written books call new testament and old testament
<|Chuck||> glassman, and what is the Quran but the same thing?
<glassman> nope
<glassman> the quran is the word of god sent thru gabriel to the prophet
<Quickshot> ahah, so via two mediums.
<Quickshot> and even if it's true. not original copy is left.
<Quickshot> not=no
<|Chuck||> And Christians believe God inspired certain men to scribe his words and teachings for posterity, much as the followers believe as they do about the Quran.
<Quickshot> so how can you know how reliable the current wording is, and secondly you can't know if you should regard it all, all to literally.
<|Chuck||> Personally, as a Christian myself, I believe ALL religions are valid.
<Quickshot> maybe, but I don't think they're all of equal value.
<glassman> Quickshot, god promise that he will protect and keep it true to its original form
<|Chuck||> They are to those who believe.    And it's really not our place to judge, is it?
<glassman> |Chuck||,, u mean told that some people are inspired>
<Quickshot> glassman: In my personal belief, the islam has fallen into the same problem as christianity and jews did in the past.  Making incorrect interpretations of the book.  No doubt there are many correct still, but today the day more then ever seem to be misusing it for there own purposes.
<glassman> yup. u r right
<|Chuck||> glassman, if I understand your question correctly, yes.
<glassman> jews, christian and islam are describe as heaven origin religion, unlike hinduism, budhist ore thje like
<glassman> they came from the same god
<Quickshot> and secondly has been checked that old versions are equal to new ones.
<|Chuck||> Yep
<glassman> only the quran is the final text and law
<|Chuck||> And therein, while I respect your view, I would disagree.
<glassman> the past , ie jesus times, only fit to jesus community, as well as Abraham times, only fit for abrahmic community
<glassman> but the quran fits mankind 
<Quickshot> that clearly can't work, as time passes, the best laws to implement become different.
<Quickshot> hmm, but jesus preached to the jews.
<glassman> inm the quran, it says that with its coming, the other two arte obselete
<|Chuck||> Gotta run, bye
<Quickshot> can be.
<glassman> Quickshot, but we are allowed adjustments to fit 
<Quickshot> but that doesn't mean they are wrong though.
<Quickshot> ahh, well it would help if many of the islamic countries implemented adjustments then.
<glassman> they are not wrong
<glassman> :)
<glassman> we are having problems here, with deviationist too
<Quickshot> ahah.
<Quickshot> well i was thinking saudi arabia or so you know.
<glassman> same as in pakistan, the talibbans are deviationist too
<glassman> do you know my prime minister?
<Quickshot> probably not, I don't know most nations prime ministers. So I don't feel to bad about it either. ^^
<glassman> DR Mahathir
<Quickshot> ok.
<Quickshot> and?
<glassman> he is one great dude
<glassman> many countries ie third world look up to him
<Quickshot> I'll take your word on it, there I don't know him.

<belmont^> god
<asilisaway> scuse me but you dont adopt a girl to later bed her
<belmont^> the naked vietnamese girl running from napalm bombs is not Mia Farrows adopted daughter LOL
<lifesuxx> revluci0n i heard that  a million times
<belmont^> asilisaway: are you sure he adopted her legally?
<asilisaway> okay i dint think so but ya never know
<ROBMAN432> well, all is fair in love and war, the most important thing is that he wasnt her biological father
<revluci0n> life, sorry
<belmont^> that vietnamese girl is now a middle aged woman
<asilisaway> he was living in a house with many children with mia as their FATHER
<glassman> leave allens affairs out of this OK?

<lifesuxx> revluci0n k
<asilisaway> he's a pervert
<ROBMAN432> well, she was an adult at the time
<asilisaway> doesnt mattah
<asilisaway> he's still a pervert
<CalCatLady> I think most of hollywood elites are a bunch of overgrown children with no common sense
<ROBMAN432> youre right there, i've heard enough from insiders
<belmont^> asilisaway: well there are always two sides to a story...yes he was legally the adopted father of some of those children when he was with Farrow but I believe that Soon Yee was not his adopted daughter
<glassman> asilisaway, I don't think he thinks he is one
<asilisaway> well yanno theres a big net out there and we can look it up
<revluci0n> the girls in his films get younger and younger
<CalCatLady> if everyone is so interested in that girl why doesn't someone look it up on the net
<belmont^> and if she was of age...then all it makes him is a cheating husband
<asilisaway> hes a perv i tell ya
<asilisaway> lol
<revluci0n> He's a perv, so what.
<asilisaway> he's a weasel
<asilisaway> yuck
<belmont^> his films are brilliant
<revluci0n> not really
<asilisaway> bah
<ROBMAN432> no she was of age i know that
<glassman> that is your view
<revluci0n> some aer funny
<CalCatLady> most hollywood are perverts just like polititians
<asilisaway> i avoid his films
<revluci0n> sleeper is one of my favorites
<asilisaway> they arent for everyone
<glassman> is allen a jew?
<belmont^> weasel yes...but so arent many people...to judge his films because of his personal life is silly...it has nothing to do with art
<ROBMAN432> yes
<asilisaway> who the hell cares
<revluci0n> Yuppo
<ROBMAN432> exactly asilisaway
<ROBMAN432> i'm sure he doesnt care that much
<asilisaway> i judged his films by my own personal entertainment levels and i dont like em
<belmont^> asilisaway: yeah right...not with that judgement you have..hehe
<glassman> we don't get that many films here, mostly commercially viable films 4 the masses
<belmont^> there isnt anything he could do in a movie that you would like now because you think he is a perv
<ROBMAN432> he's just a guy with a personal life
<asilisaway> i have an opinion yer welcum to disagree
<belmont^> glassman: you are missing out on some wonderful smaller films
<glassman> yeah
<glassman> :(
<belmont^> glassman: Ill mail some to ya hehe ;)
<asilisaway> no i dont watch his movies because I dont find them entertaining.. i think he's a perv because he raised the kid he eventually fucked
<glassman> but films 4 me are not merely 4 entertaining
<ROBMAN432> i like some of his movies
<belmont^> LOL
<glassman> th kid is not his to begin with
<ROBMAN432> very odd way of observing things, that's his genius
<belmont^> asilisaway: that is so off base hehe...he didnt raise Soon Yee!
<Makimota> hello
<belmont^> and you say you dont care hehe
<glassman> and the end of it
<asilisaway> he lived in the house as the father figure
<ROBMAN432> well, she was probably very subservient by nature, and welcomed it
<belmont^> asilisaway: you are assuming that...you do not know if he was a father to her...she was of age
<asilisaway> ya and he is a letch by nature and took advantage
<ROBMAN432> he wanted a young girl
<ROBMAN432> of age mind you
<glassman> let get this outta here ok people, enough of allen
<belmont^> who doesnt as long as they are of age? :)
<ROBMAN432> exactly
<revluci0n> Nothing wrong with an age difference as long as consent is there
<revluci0n> and majority
<ROBMAN432> exactly
<asilisaway> she wasnt of age when it first bacme an issue
<belmont^> consent is essential of course
<ROBMAN432> we dont know that asilisaway
<asilisaway> he was letchin before she turned 18
<asilisaway> lets look it up
<ROBMAN432> how do you know that?
<glassman> yeah , and some did reply that 2 me when I said that Bush's daughters are acoholics
--- Starting response with 'acoholics'
--- Responding: 'and that's chemical weapons... '
<dubbya> and that's chemical weapons... 
<asilisaway> i member
<asilisaway> it sickened me
<ROBMAN432> i think some of the groundwork was there for it yes, but i dont think he was sexual with her before she was of age
<glassman> or titotallers
<belmont^> you dont have to be 18...perhaps to have sex but not to be in a relationship
<Quickshot> bye
<ROBMAN432> that's true belmont
<ROBMAN432> many men go for younger women, women of age
<belmont^> CalCatLady: what is your solution?

<glassman> CalCatLady,, how come they drop some on residential houses? no where near any military zone, samrt bomb my foot!!!
<asilisaway> shit happens
<ROBMAN432> i have a logical question, why would anyone ever want to be a democrat
<asilisaway> hehee
<belmont^> they need to begin NOT worrying about civilian casualties as much as worrying about the lives of the troops
<ROBMAN432> true belmont
<Chilled> maybe they bombed those houses because there were people tied to saddam in there ?
<ROBMAN432> a tough war to win
<belmont^> Chilled: good point
<ROBMAN432> no, a mistake
<ROBMAN432> it's a war, it happens
<CalCatLady> i think people are too worried about where the shells hit.. no one worried about that during WW1 or WW2
<belmont^> not tough unless you concern yourself with public outcry than in securing your own soldiers
<asilisaway> we dont really know so it must be time ti diddle
<asilisaway> -i+o
<Chilled> times and situations is different now Cal
<ROBMAN432> no one got the same degree of reporting as we do today
<asilisaway> hehehee
<glassman> Chilled> yeah, maybe
<CapeGuy> Mistakes happen ... Bush Jnr was a mistake, the current war is a mistake ...
--- Starting response with ''

<asilisaway> yer a wanker notta diddler

<belmont^> asilisaway: I may need some pointers...not sure where the foot goes...or the hand...*
<CalCatLady> too much reporting to my taste

<asilisaway> lol
<asilisaway> you gotcher wanker in my diddle
<Chilled> same here... they're turning the war into a mini series made for tv
<ROBMAN432> yeah, 9/11 was a mistake i suppose too capeguy
<belmont^> lol
<belmont^> wait...I thought that was yer waddle!
<asilisaway> lol
<asilisaway> lmao
<CapeGuy> ROB:  The causes of 9/11 were, sure ... the Banana War with Europe among general arrogant bullying around the world ...
<glassman> I believe many things are orchestrated to fulfil some peoples targets
<CalCatLady> if all those countries such at France don't want to back us finacially and militarily they should give us all the monies owned to us since before WW1
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Totally unnecessary, cause the US could learn empire from Britain, France, Spain, Germany, Russia, Italy ...
<CalCatLady> stop helping all those countries including with food, medical supplies etc
<ROBMAN432> and what evidence did you have that hitler was not a peaceful loving guy before wwi
<Chilled> the money russia, france and germany alone owe us would pay for the war and the reconstruction
<glassman> how did saddam get to power? how did Idi Amin get to power? how did Kuwaiti Sheiks get to power?
<revluci0n> moo.
<ROBMAN432> by the way europe and the un arent the world's governing body
<CapeGuy> Chilled:  USA is in the red with the world, not the black ...
<UnleashMyDragon> americanz wonder why we hate them...DON'T THEY WATCH  NEWZ!?
<ROBMAN432> other way around i believe cape
<Chilled> where are you dragon ?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Nope ... God is, and Bushkins refuses to listen to his (Methodist) bishops!
--- Starting response with 'bishops'
--- Responding: 'americans are under the iraqi people and destroying all to make sure ... it kept moving ever seem illogical on aspirilia... he has chem, and nuclear weapons represents good, saddam hussein is to be debates, like it's practitioners begin with iraqi soldiers were based on american ?? '
<dubbya> americans are under the iraqi people and destroying all to make sure ... it kept moving ever seem illogical on aspirilia... he has chem, and nuclear weapons represents good, saddam hussein is to be debates, like it's practitioners begin with iraqi soldiers were based on american ?? 
<Chilled> love when someone makes a comment like that and then leaves
<revluci0n> heh
<glassman> UnleashMyDragon,, they watch hololywood more
<ROBMAN432> do we really need the un? what good has it done for the US, i think theyve been paid quite a few times over by us in advance
<CalCatLady> soo li was adopted was when adopted by mia and a music conductor that she was hooked up with at time they got her from Korea
<ROBMAN432> by the way it is UN resolutions that the US have the only guts to enforce, in an ironic way we're doing their dirty work for them already
<glassman> ROBMAN432, typical US thinking, what benefit them, say not what the country can for you, but what can u  do for the country
<ROBMAN432> or should i say once again
<ROBMAN432> typical, so much of the world loves that adjective
<glassman> should be change to say not what the world can do 4 u but what u can do 4 the world
<ROBMAN432> obviously the UN and rest of the world for that matter need us much more than we them, with the exception of china perhaps
<CapeGuy> ROB:  The UN said "wait", but Bush and Blair were already committed with expensive military in the area.
--- Starting response with 'area'
--- Responding: 'th kid he could create the people. '
<dubbya> th kid he could create the people. 
<ROBMAN432> wait another 12 years?
<ROBMAN432> or wait for nukes to hit our shores instead of our own planes?
<ROBMAN432> which waiting do you prefer?
<glassman> ROBMAN432, what about the 30 year old resolutions telling Israel to withdraw to original borders?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Waiting another 12 years is better than having The Lady, Empire State, San Fran Bridge and every symbol of America flattened by a new generation of terrorists!
--- Starting response with 'terrorists'
--- Responding: 'terrorists detained in the war against these 12 years, iraq and that agreement '
<dubbya> terrorists detained in the war against these 12 years, iraq and that agreement 
<ROBMAN432> israel was invaded in 67, so they are holding the high ground, they didnt bring that on themselves
<ROBMAN432> i think that's the very thing we're out to avoid by taking iraq out of the equation
--- Starting response with 'equation'
--- Responding: 'my own personal interest. '
<dubbya> my own personal interest. 
<glassman> and bush is gona ask congress to release 80 billion or ist 800 billion 2 cover the war
--- Starting response with 'war'
--- Responding: 'war on foreign oil they only fit to be able to hell im not telling how do you saying it '
<dubbya> war on foreign oil they only fit to be able to hell im not telling how do you saying it 
<Chilled> what about the palestinians who killed israeli's that started the war that israel conquered the land for ?  tell the parents (if they havent been killed also) that the lives lost during the war was for nothing ?
<glassman> is it
<ROBMAN432> 80 billion is 3 days or less then our entire GDP
<CalCatLady> the middle east has been fighting since the beginning of time they will never change
<ROBMAN432> not a problem
<glassman> ROBMAN432>,, that make it legaL?
<asilisaway> belmont has put me into diddle mode... later yallllllll
<Chilled> problem is back in 42 when the UN was established and the GAVE the land to the jews to begin with.... but you can't undo that now
<asilisaway> LOL
<belmont^> LOL
<belmont^> bye now hehe
<ROBMAN432> it is legal, they are the UN resolutions
<asilisaway> byeeeeee
<revluci0n> bye
<ROBMAN432> severe consequences = war, dont you think?
<Chilled> yes it was glassman
<CalCatLady> just quit buying their oil and see how fast they stop fighting since they all want american $$
<ROBMAN432> we dont need authority from the un to protect ourselves
<revluci0n> ROBMAN,charter says all war must be explicitly permitted by security council
<ROBMAN432> not in the US charter, vote by congress
<glassman> u tthink people are after USD?
<revluci0n> the UN charter
<ROBMAN432> again the UN doesnt govern the US
<glassman> lol
<Chilled> and if the leftests in the states stopped fighting the expansion in Alaska of fuel oil none of this would be happening... like who cares if one more owl dies ? gimme a break
<revluci0n> we are a member state aint we
<ROBMAN432> no i think that the war is easy to pay off
<ROBMAN432> amen chilled
<ROBMAN432> a member state? what is that?
<glassman> US citizens think that the rest of the world are panhandlers
<CalCatLady> kicke the UN out of the USA
<Chilled> what does that mean glassman ?
<CalCatLady> rest of world are panhandlings
<glassman> <CalCatLady> just quit buying their oil and see how fast they stop fighting since they all want american $$
<ROBMAN432> would it offend you if the US didnt have an opion at all about who you are?
<ROBMAN432> the UN isnt in the US thankfully, they just dont realize that
<revluci0n> I hope the US doesnt have any opinion on who I am in the slightest
<Chilled> lol and to think two years ago bush didnt even know the name of the french pres ! oh this is all so funny when you step back and look at it
--- Starting response with 'it'
--- Responding: 'it has a year which can change and respectful, and the oppression of sledging? '
<dubbya> it has a year which can change and respectful, and the oppression of sledging? 
<ROBMAN432> rest assure then
<CalCatLady> I don't buy foreign oil
<glassman> what people want is peace so that they can get on with their lives
<CalCatLady> i don't even have a car
<ROBMAN432> do we need an historian to be president? or a member of his administrative staff, its not just one guy you know
<glassman> they don't want aid that they have to pay back tenfolds
<ROBMAN432> is Iraq a peaceful country?
--- Starting response with 'country'
--- Responding: 'country poses a symbol of the united nations '
<dubbya> country poses a symbol of the united nations 
<ROBMAN432> is that what they say in kuwait?
<ROBMAN432> the US poses a symbol of itself thank you
<ROBMAN432> is that what the kurds say too?
<Chilled> payback? since when does anyone ever payback ?
<ROBMAN432> we pay enough
<CalCatLady> We should not help rebuild Iraq after the war either -- no americian $$ going to middle east
--- Starting response with 'east'
--- Responding: 'east have no more scuds or injured nearly 900 people, medical care to serve our resolve, we want to the un '
<dubbya> east have no more scuds or injured nearly 900 people, medical care to serve our resolve, we want to the un 
<CapeGuy> The USA has told other countries to close Iraqi missions and expel staff, freeze assets ... what stupidity!
--- Starting response with 'stupidity'
--- Responding: 'well advised to belittle our coalition military action, but thaey are all those obligations as been firing into kuwait the same reason i make more companies to commit an arsenal from the un weapons inspector of nations security council to make our environment in there are all :)) '
<dubbya> well advised to belittle our coalition military action, but thaey are all those obligations as been firing into kuwait the same reason i make more companies to commit an arsenal from the un weapons inspector of nations security council to make our environment in there are all :)) 
<ROBMAN432> yes we should rebuild iraq, i agree we should
--- Starting response with 'should'
--- Responding: 'should be longer in cheif '
<dubbya> should be longer in cheif 
<ROBMAN432> why is that stupid?
<ROBMAN432> should we recommend they support iraq while we're at war with them?
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them on anything. how will meet today, we wouldn't destroy iraq's people come to an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick '
<dubbya> them on anything. how will meet today, we wouldn't destroy iraq's people come to an arrogant, belligerant narcissistic prick 
<CapeGuy> How the hell will they be monitored for terrorists they breed, disbursal of funds etc?
--- Starting response with 'etc'
--- Responding: 'before it could have an objective analysis '
<dubbya> before it could have an objective analysis 
<ROBMAN432> based on the interests of the countries that we are asking, which i assume are very dependent on us as it is
<ROBMAN432> ?
<glassman> Chilled> se indonesia, follow the routine or else no aid

<ROBMAN432> see north korea? how much better are they?
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Exactly, we are weary of it ... Planet Hollywood and two others in my city!  You guys must entertain your terrs at home now, please!
<glassman> <CalCatLady  ever heard of royalties or what ever the terhm they use?
<ROBMAN432> i think that should be allowed, we are america and should be able to produce better product, else allow us to spend our money on imports
<ROBMAN432> i dont follow your point cape
<glassman> KFC, McD, all get a cut froim busines in these countries
<CalCatLady> no imports! Imports put AMerican workers out of work
<ROBMAN432> lol, it's a kid's restauraunt

<ROBMAN432> yes, it's a war
<ROBMAN432> it's a war
<glassman> CalCatLady,, busineseess put workers out of work, employers put workers out of work, not imports
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Good ... enjoy your bombings in the USA then, and don't weep any more about the WTC!
<CalCatLady> i am sorry about kids being hurt, but how many of them have weapons of some kind and do what the kids in Nam did to our soldiers
<ROBMAN432> that's why we're fighting, we were already bombed without a war on 9/11
<ROBMAN432> so why so surprised that we want to stop someone from doing it again?
<glassman> what this war is gonna create is anyones guess
<CapeGuy> ROB:  VERY belatedly -- we elsewhere in the West have taken your bombs before the WTC, and we're tired of it.
<ROBMAN432> everyone needs us until we find a need to stop people from killing us
<ROBMAN432> so let's maybe put a stop to it? dont you think?
<CalCatLady> well got to go and get ready for work

<CapeGuy> Glass:  The ones now in power, Colin aside, are twits.
<ROBMAN432> no, i think we're somewhat afraid though of being attacked again
<belmont^> CapeGuy: I would agree they are twits...but they do follow through on what they say

<ROBMAN432> i just dont want to be killed while in the wtc in my city
<Bullgator> Her name is Phan Thi Kim Phuc and she  was named a UNESCO goodwill ambassador
<ROBMAN432> that's real enough for me

<glassman> Bullgator,, yup, was she mia farrows and woody allen's adopted girl?
<belmont^> lol
<Bullgator> no .. glassman she wasn't
<belmont^> here is an online story about that girl http://www.womentodaymagazine.com/features/kim_phuc.html

<belmont^> lol
<belmont^> no news
<ROBMAN432> oh ok
<belmont^> he somehow snuck himself in there...like he does with all his kids LOL
<ROBMAN432> Woody isnt really on my list today sorry
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: WOody or "a woddy"? LOL
<ROBMAN432> he can screw whomever he wants, as long as they are of age and want it back
<Bullgator> beats me ROBMAN432 .. someone asked me about it in another channel .. she left .. thought I'd tell ya'll 
<belmont^> Bullgator: thanks for the info
<CapeGuy> ROB:  Trouble is the USA presents itself so much through Hollywood, not Washington.

<Bullgator> ya'll take care .. laterz
<ROBMAN432> late
<belmont^> CapeGuy: no...the US does not present itself through Hollywood...people CHOOSE for themselves as to how they wish to view the US
<ROBMAN432> exactly, they watch the news like it's a talk show
<glassman> ROBMAN432, I was telling about when that foto of the napalm bomb girl came out in the papers, that I saw it when it 1st came out

<ROBMAN432> glass: yeah?
<ROBMAN432> i remember that photo
<ROBMAN432> close minded more like, have you tried talking about abortion with a democrat? or god forbid lighting a cigarette?
<CapeGuy> Glass:  That photo must be the most remembers in the world.
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: sorry I cant agree with you there...I think anyone who labels themselves by a political affiliation needs therapy :)
<belmont^> I independently think for myself :)
<ROBMAN432> it's our innate need to belong to some form of membership
<glassman> Bullgator>  also the foto of vietnamese captain executing a suspected vietcong spy in south vietnam,, saying that we already that old
<ROBMAN432> yes glassman

<belmont^> thats the latest
<ROBMAN432> not sure, it was the ending of the war
<glassman> the movie cos I don't or didn't see the foto u r talking about
<belmont^> I think the picture of the sailor kissing a girl was in a US city somewhere...
<belmont^> perhaps new york
<glassman> but I remember the foto of returning US soldier being greeted by family, very heart warming
<ROBMAN432> it was a celebration of wwII ending, i think ticker taped, and this sailor was dipping this nurse and kissing her
<ROBMAN432> yes belmont
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: yes...ticker taped...thats why I thought it may be New york where such parades are famous
<ROBMAN432> right
<ROBMAN432> supposed to be the most famous picture ever
<ROBMAN432> i heard it might have been staged though
<belmont^> couldbe
<ROBMAN432> they never found the people again to ask
<ROBMAN432> that were in the photo
<belmont^> though that cover of National Geographic of that Afghani girl with the amazing eyes is pretty memorable
<Bullgator> 12B14y 12T14he 12W14ay belmont^ .. you have seen that pic right ???

<Bullgator> ok .. just wonderin
<ROBMAN432> good question
<KurtChicago> Why doesn't the USAF drop MOABs on the Republican Guard???
<ROBMAN432> so far the most memorable is when Bush was nearly brought to tears while choking on words describing his anger and frustration against 9/11
--- Starting response with '9/11'

<belmont^> she is married to David Bowie, yes?
<KurtChicago> Iman, the somali chick, is married to David Bowie
<KurtChicago> He likes chocolate
<ROBMAN432> the afghan girl's eyes are the most amazing i've ever seen
<glassman> maybe that someone who pluck Iman from the savannahs can pluck this girl to fame
<belmont^> KurtChicago: it aint all that bad :)
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: my father used to subscribe to National Geographic when I was young and I remember that cover...so striking...
<belmont^> amazing they found her
<ROBMAN432> incredible
<Bullgator> lol, when you were young
<glassman> belmont^, when one can see beauty in one's color, the one is in darkness
<belmont^> glassman: not sure what you mean
<glassman> I must add only
<KurtChicago> i prefer blond women
<glassman> Bullgator, the foto that I saw when young was in different angle
<Bullgator> There were a couple of diff photos of that .. but that one was the most famous
<glassman> with the girls mouth wide open and crying
<belmont^> ok guys...here it is...the picture of the sailor kissing the girl...it took place in times square on VJ day
<belmont^> http://www.iconblvd.com/picts/life/3_V-J-Day.jpg

<ROBMAN432> or the nurse
<glassman> I know that one
<KurtChicago> What about Brody kissking Hale Berry?
<ROBMAN432> yes, the most famous photo ever
<glassman> but I think the sailor just taking advantage of the atmosphere
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: on that same site you can do a search on afghan girl and they have a signed poster, signed by the photographer...of the afghan girl
<glassman> lol
<Bullgator> http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0311_020312_sharbat.html

<belmont^> ohgod
<KurtChicago> Bullgator, and did the GI's impale that bitch?
<belmont^> how do you fight such an enemny other than to consider them all the enemy?
<Bullgator> Needless to say .. she, the baby and many standing around are not with us today
<glassman> vietnam maybe asian, like I am but I am muslim, 
<belmont^> Bullgator: I hope our soldiers do the same in this warm and stop worrying about being so strategic
<belmont^> Rodgers: 1,000 armed vehicles in convoy, could reach U.S. troops tonight
<ROBMAN432> why arent the US just hitting them from the air?
<glassman> belmont^> Rodgers, some one is gonna get cooked tonight
<KurtChicago> I believe that when civilians start attacking troops, then they should be attacked back... 
<Bullgator> glassman I have nothing against the Muslim people or Asian people .. but those that use religon to kill and maim innocent people have no place on this earth
<ROBMAN432> normally they are considered army infantry if they attack
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: I am hoping that they have a plan to wait until they are as far away from baghdad so they cannot retreat and then shell the hell out of them
<glassman> KurtChicago,, I agree
<ROBMAN432> right belmont
<ROBMAN432> there is no element of surprise at least
<belmont^> ROBMAN432`: they have that MOAB bomb...this is the perfect time to use the mother :)
<glassman> KurtChicago but only the ones with gun in hand
<Bullgator> If it was me I'd bring back Napalm
<ROBMAN432> the US should block from the rear and surround them
<glassman> Bullgator,, u wouldn't like to be there, why u wish some one else be there ?
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: I dont know that we have enough soldiers on the ground there to do that
<Bullgator> glassman if my health was good .. I'd be there in a heartbeat
<glassman> I mean in the napalm range
<ROBMAN432> well, block any ability for retreat by blowing behind them from air
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: from your lips to Tommy Franks' ears
<ROBMAN432> lol, like i know anything
<belmont^> ROBMAN432: you know enough to know we should be far concern with the safety of our troops than Iraqi civilians when they are being used as human shields

<dubbya> shields for health care, and situations is only derives little to my rage 
<Bullgator> glassman .. they (Sadam's Republic Guards) are killing their own people there is nothing that I wouldn't do to try to stop the inhumane acts 
<glassman> In Vietnam the veterans organizations are very meager. There have not been much assistance for war veterans 
<ROBMAN432> i wish there was a way to just convince them to surrender
<glassman> from the pics
<glassman> why would u create more vets?
<Bullgator> glassman .. explane that ???
<glassman> that was a sentence from the url u gave, so why create more vets? when even vietnam vets are not assisted properly
<Bullgator> I know veterans are getting cut short by the G'vt right now .. but organizations like the American Leigon and VFW are trying to help as much as they can
<glassman> don't people ever learn?
<ROBMAN432> theyll learn
<glassman> right now? 
<glassman> how long has it been since the vietnam war?
<Bullgator> My health care has been cut back a little because of G've cut backs .. but the Veterans organizations are trying to get them increased

<ROBMAN432> no reported damages yet
<ROBMAN432> they are currently engaged in battle
<RufusTFirefly> Cracks me up how the media reports on the war on a minute by minute basis, like a war is fought that way.
<Bullgator> I agree RufusTFirefly
<ROBMAN432> what do you mean?
<glassman> RufusTFirefly> do not be too happy over war
<RufusTFirefly> "We'll have more war coverage, right after these messages."
<RufusTFirefly> Who said I was happy about it, glassman?
<Bullgator> and, watching this news conference, I am still amazed at the dumb questions that reporters ask

<RufusTFirefly> Yeah, I'm on the funny side, and you're on the unfunny side.
<ROBMAN432> is that what the war is about?
<glassman> do you people really believe that this war is about liberation?

<glassman> Bullgator,, you think all muslims, will sit still? 
<Bullgator> That could be
<Bullgator> glassman .. it's not about muslims it's about FREEDOM from opression
<ROBMAN432> right bullgator
<ROBMAN432> what he said
<glassman> this is a war against thier brothers ,mine too, but I am sane, and open, unlike the talibans, or some other leser educated muslim
<ROBMAN432> so only the smart ones are your brothers?
<glassman> all are , u too
<ROBMAN432> this isnt a holy war as far as i can determine
<glassman> its disguise, but is a holy war
<Bullgator> Correct ROBMAN432 .. it's NOT a holy war .. it's about FREEDOM
<ROBMAN432> that's the problem, everyone who cant really justify themselves in time of war make it a war about religion, everyone suddenly has god on their side
<Bullgator> so glassman .. you are saying that you would like to live under the likes of Sadam ??
<glassman> it the culmination of an orchestrated......... I don't know the word
<Bullgator> There has been more people killed in the name of "God" than for any other cause in history
<ROBMAN432> call it what you want, i just dont want anyone killing us in the name of whatever god you think tells you to
<ROBMAN432> EXACTLY bullgator
<glassman> we are not taught to kill
<ROBMAN432> no? who teaches it? god?
<glassman> that the kind of misinformation you are fed on
<Bullgator> glassman .. did anyone say that you are ??
<ROBMAN432> i feel realistically informed
<xLapatsas> Bullgator: and probably as many (if not anymore) in the name of money/greed
<glassman> anyone killing us in the name of god
<ROBMAN432> saddam isnt greedy?
<xLapatsas> anymore = manymor
<Bullgator> xLapatsas .. but most of those go back to "In the name of God" 
<ROBMAN432> yep
<glassman> bush did say in the name of god, I presume?

<dubbya> who saddam hussein still amazing... 
<ROBMAN432> i'm so tired with that holy war thing, and greed for money motive that the people are too blind to see, what crap
<xLapatsas> Bullgator: the "in the name of god" is an excuse, not the reason, historically most/if not all the wars have been faught for dominance, rerources, money/power etc

<BabyJazz> i had it for five months was just lucky mine did not burst

<ickythe> lurgyman: so the goal is to do nothing as quickly, and as effeciently as possible
<lurgyman> yyyyyyyep
<ffafu> Duffster, we don't live in that kind of world any more. Our economy is international. The Saddamite traitors say this war is all about oil. Of course, that's nonsense. But actually, if we were not able to defend our access to oil, our enemies could cut us off to strangle us. The same could be said for any of our foreign markets. It's about national survival in an international economy.
<MeatHook> ickythe: that's so wrong, you should be in IRC detention
<ickythe> MeatHook: I am unattached at the moment
<Twobar> gawd my dog is so picky.  He will only eat his dog food if I add in canned cat food, butter, and worchestire sauce.  No, I am not kidding.
<Duffster> everyone knows, everyone knows that saddam is a modern-day hitler and we're doin the right thing but i really think most of us thought that iraqis would quit and join us to rid of his regime...  having the arab news networks giving biased news reports is not gonna help us...
<ickythe> MeatHook: howw so?
<panini> i wish this war WAS about oil
<MeatHook> ickythe: the goal of government should be to cover our collective asses and keep the domestic peace, that's about it
<BabyJazz> hehe twobar
<Twobar> and the dam dog is only about 18 weeks old
<ickythe> MeatHook: right, thats the "nothing"
<Twobar> he already humps legs
<MeatHook> ickythe: heh... that's a BIG nothing =]
<BabyJazz> my dog is picky unless my other dog is standing in front of the food bowl then she eats it so he cant
<Duffster> Twobar, its spring time now, he's in heat  :)
<Kocur> twobar trained his dog to hump his leg

<Duffster> ScuZzy160, yea thats what i'm talkin about, this is a serious problem, plus we're fighting a political correct war, you cant do this, you cant do that, blah blah blah
<Rebec> that the arabs support continued oppression

<ffafu> It's too bad we're not getting complete translations of what Saddam, and other Arab leaders, are telling their people. Specifically, they're saying the United States is controlled by Jews, that Jews are using the United States to take over the whole Middle East, that the Jews want the oil so they can rule the world and destroy Islam. Odd how the "antiwar" movement agrees with Saddam, that this is just about oil.
<Daedalus2> SHEP's ON!
<Daedalus2> the man is a machine!
<Duffster> ScuZzy160, i honestly do not know much about Vietnam, other than history books, i wasnt alive then...

<ScuZzy160> Duffster: me neither
<MeatHook> http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/finalmeals.htm  <== a personal favorite of mine
<Pickle> The arabs who support Saddam DO support continued oppression.  And it shouldn't be surprising that so many arabs do--a quick look at the region should give anyone a good idea of the preferred mode of government in the area.
<Daedalus2> yeah, just heard that
<BabyJazz> shep?
<raoul> sure glad connie chung is gone
<Rebec> Scuzzy I think he does, but I was just wondering what the arabs were doing to make you think they support oppression
<Duffster> well, if they execute our soldiers, fuggem
<Re2k3> damn, greta is plain
<ScuZzy160> Rebec: all of the arab world and arab news are all pro-Saddam
<Re2k3> hi rebec
<BabyJazz> she is just gone during the war from what i have heard raoul
<ScuZzy160> they like Iraqis being put in shredders I guess
<Duffster> Re2k3, she sucks, her facelift really didnt help her that much, am i wrong?
<MeatHook> Duffster: we won't fuggem... we'll still go light to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties
<raoul> BabyJazz: she was canceled
<Pickle> Kuwait isn't.
<BabyJazz> wow
<Duffster> MeatHook, then this is gonna be another Vietnam
<Daedalus2> Shep=Shepard Smith
<ScuZzy160> the only people who are anti-Saddam are the Iraqis
<BabyJazz> aww
<Re2k3> duff:  she's no longer ugly... now she's just plain, and her mouth is still crooked

<BabyJazz> my jazz are kicking a little blazer butt :)
<Duffster> Re2k3, hahahah, okay
<Daedalus2> that guy's running on the new Energizer batteries, i swear
<the-anti> I wonder how many "civilians" we have spared so far were actually soldiers and republican guard
<Duffster> CometBaby, where u at?
<ffafu> Doesn't al Jazeera promote that theory that 9/11 was a Mossad operation, that Mossad controlled those jets remotely and crashed them into their targets, that the Arab terrorists aboard weren't even aware of what was going to happen? I'll tell you, there's this Arab I work with who goes on and on about that theory, and all he ever watches is al Jazeera.
<Daedalus2> anti: tons
<MeatHook> greta would make a good fuck buddy... you could have at it and never chance actually developing feeling for her
<raoul> who's the redhead with the bright blue eyes on cnn these days?
<Daedalus2> eww i can't even picture that with Greta
<Duffster> ffafu, who knows, i think American ppl are finally a gettin taste of the culture over in the middle east first hand now...  and it aint positive...
<Daedalus2> i'd be seeing her old pictures in my head
<MeatHook> come on D... you know you want her
<Re2k3> maybe with a bag over her head, and/or from behind
<MeatHook> that droopy Botox brow... that crooked Botox mouth... you WANT her! =]
<Duffster> Re2k3, hahaha, yure baaaaaaad
<Daedalus2> she looks like a halloween mask
<Pickle> ffafu, if it does, it's merely reflecting the rabid antisemitism of the arab world.  And it wouldn't suprise me: we're talking about a part of the world where mainstream newspapers report that Jews use the blood of arab children to prepare holiday bread.
<Cartman1> greta's a two-bagger, you gotta wear a bag on your head in case hers falls off
<Duffster> i like greta, shes fairly objective
<Duffster> Cartman1, haha
<Duffster> what in the world happened to Connie Chung????????  haha
<JonEFever> She only came to Fox for the money.. all leftists are basically whores who will sell their shaky "belief system" for enough dollars

<MeatHook> you know what? dumbasses who say that americans "aren't really free" have never bloody lived in a country where your freedoms are seriously infringed upon
<Duffster> MeatHook, true
<BabyJazz> faux pas is french for clusterfuck :)
<ScuZzy160> I just don't know what the OKC faux pas was, or who committed it
<Duffster> BabyJazz, LOLOL
<MeatHook> I suggest any of you who fit that description move to Cairo or Tripoli for a while
<BabyJazz> hehe
<Duffster> fubar  :)
<Duffster> man if they really did execute all of our pows, screw the rules
<ScuZzy160> all of them ?
<MeatHook> Once you get a taste of what the rest of the world is fed as "freedom" ... you'll never again complain about the taste of US freedom

<Duffster> Kaliuna, yea, i heard that
<MeatHook> Duffster: I'd be in for about 3 dozen MOABS
<Kaliuna> Duff -- disgusting...
<ScuZzy160> no one wants to tell what Connie Chung's(?) big faux pas in OKCity was ? Kaliuna ?
<the-anti> I am pretty sure the United States, overall, has more laws prohibiting behaviours than any other country in the history of mankind.  You can be "not really free" and still have a high standard of living...
<MeatHook> Duffster: strategically placed, of course
<Kaliuna> and they found several US/UK look alike uniforms left behind in a Fayadeen (?SP) bunker
<Duffster> Kaliuna, i know, u hear those b-2s takin off down there?
<MeatHook> the-anti: you are delusional
<Kaliuna> yup
<ThinIcer> MeatHook: my father lived under communism; he considers this country very free by comparision, but he sees American freedom at risk........from the very government that is supposed to protect it
<ScuZzy160> the-anti is just talking about drugs and butt-sex cos that's what he's all about
<MeatHook> the-anti: and having lived in Canada, Mexico, US, and the Middle East I can assure you that your "pretty sure" is way off base

<the-anti> Executing the POW's is the last straw.  I now support forcing our POW's to sit through a 3-hour Clinton speech.

<MeatHook> I say we send the monkeys back to Morrocco and use their POWs to search for mines
<Duffster> sick

<MeatHook> ThinIcer: err, 60 billion
<praxis9> Well, the loser Arabs need something to keep them in a state of irrational lunacy. So they turn to executions to take their minds off being such backward little sand people.
<the-anti> Duffster, they'll probably call it heroic bravery
<Duffster> Bush 41 sucked, we shouldve demanded him to be gone
<ThinIcer> MeatHook: well actually, the US offered it, Turkey considered it, and they still voted against it
<Duffster> the-anti, probably right
<Pickle> praxis, jawas?

<falter> sigh
<Kaliuna> Chin -- they are starving -- so ya they were pretty bad getting to foods... but understandable in circumstances
<falter> once again i think George W. got the general idea wrong, but has now screwed up the details yet again
<ThinIcer> MeatHook: we were offering to give Turkey billions in aid, they were considering the offer, and voted it down in parliament; hence there is no Northern front of mechanized units
<MeatHook> dollard? dollars
<praxis9> icky: Sure, sweetheart. I'll just act like a worm and little angels will float down from heaven.
<praxis9> We all know that.
<Duffster> praxis9, hehe
<plusplusC> ThinIcer: The difference between blackmail and bribery is whether the buyer is willing or not to pay handsomely in return for some desired behavior or exchange
<the-anti> Turkey is a bunch of turkeys
<ickythe> praxis9: I am not advocating stupidity, what I am advocating is firewalling ourselves from hate, that hate will not consume us
<MeatHook> ThinIcer: we were offering aid that was long overdue, considering we left them with more trouble after we left GW1 than before we came
<Duffster> gobble gobble

<MeatHook> Turkey didn't want to get stuck with billions in damages and debts plus another Kurd uprising... I don't blame them... but they went way too high with their demands

<TimothyWT> Groom Lake is shutdown
<Duffster> JonEFever, i agree
<Swigert> pickle: best they give up their empire
<plusplusC> a dirty tactic isn't necessarily a cowardly one...after all, the soldiers faking surrender more probably than not are going down themselves in order to take a few of us with them

<MeatHook> Duffster: in their case that will end up being a strength, not a weakness
<falter> why the hell didn't bush put down more troops

<dubbya> troops in the enemies only to protect this is limited 
<JonEFever> bagdad's average elevation will soon be several feet lower

<skezz> and 2) it's not Bush's call

<dubbya> call this kind of morality and the countries are going to happen, a broad and the straits of war was met with th down because we could hardly get free people you need 
<skezz> it's Franks
<falter> well whoever's call it is, they made a bad call
<skezz> falter:  Oh really?
<TimothyWT> NavySeal : nope that place has been shutdown no one wants to go out there....
<MeatHook> Duffster: the fact that we care more about their civilians than they do will be part of their strategy
<falter> yeah
<ThinIcer> 300,000 troops supported by thousands of high-tech combat aircraft and bombers and mechanized armor isn't enough for a two-bit third world country like Iraq?

<dubbya> iraq continues to get a dictatorship, it'd be blackmailed" so thanks for you teach the world country 
<Duffster> MeatHook, yea but the politics must be shown to the arab side...
<skezz> falter:  Coming from your comfy lil` arm chair, I assume that must be a hard judgement
<JonEFever> watch Syria
<falter> put 400-500,000 men with their backs to the wall, plus terrorists/paramilitaries, and you need a hell of lot more than a quarter million troops, unless you're bringing nukes
<Brak55> falter: They're calling up 30000 more.
<Duffster> MeatHook, thats the problem, but the REALITY is right now is that the rest of the Arab ppl dont see that becuz of the incredible bias they are getting from their own networks....
<Kaliuna> yup Brak -- 
<Chindogg> (falter): this war's lasted a week and we're 50mi from baghdad, how can that be bad?
<Brak55> Sorry if that's already been said, I was away for a bit.
<plusplusC> Thin: Maybe the attitude that we're taking on a "two-bit third world country" could be a significant part of the problem.  Iraq isn't Vietnam in most ways, but in terms of the 'tude the US has going in, it's eerily similar.
--- Starting response with 'similar'

<dubbya> these include a good night, and our country, to use billions of the united nations of nations, that all our freedom, and delaying has violated that kuwait, the amount

<plusplusC> Pickle: "dubbya" is obviously satarizing George W's fractured syntax and thought process
<Pickle> I suspect a bot as well.
<Duffster> MeatHook, thats exactly correct, they have no concept of individual liberty whatsoever...
<the-anti> The generals are not executing this war anything like Vietnam, from what I can see.
<ThinIcer> plusplus: what I was seeing before were accounts made by numerous neo-cons and military experts predicting a quick and easy campaign where the Iraqi regime would capitulate after a week; now I'm reading in the Washington Post that some US military officials are saying the war could last months
--- Starting response with 'months'
--- Responding: 'months and urged the shareholder on a democratic palestine '
<dubbya> months and urged the shareholder on a democratic palestine 
<Chindogg> (falter): perhaps, but this war wont last a omnth
<Chindogg> month*
<MeatHook> since it's spouting gibberish, I vote bot as well

<ickythe> ye Gods, we struck first lady!
<Duffster> the-anti, did you live thru Vietnam war?
<falter> when i hear of tanks stuck in the desert for lack of fuel, and a string of tankers desperately trying to make it to them, i start wondering about the planning of this war
<ickythe> we're rich!
<ThinIcer> praxis: I never said Rumsfeld
<plusplusC> ThinIcer: Yes exactly; we underestimated both the Iraqui capability and willingness to fight, and miscalculated that the Iraqui people's lack of real love for Saddam equates to love for us as would-be liberators.
--- Starting response with 'liberators'
--- Responding: 'and the UN security council have directed against iran, and protect our second thought... they're being unilaterally subverted by thousands of biological weapons '
<dubbya> and the UN security council have directed against iran, and protect our second thought... they're being unilaterally subverted by thousands of biological weapons 
<|bob> rumsfeld always says as little as possible
<praxis9> ThinIcer: Who, then? O'Reilly?
<MeatHook> wow, that text parser doesn't even have decent grammar or syntax checking... weak
<skezz> falter:  Which you would do such a better job as eh?
<falter> if the iraqi's had been just a bit more organized they could have hit those trucks and thrown the whole plan into chaos

<Duffster> mcnamara sucked
<falter> that's exactly the problem
<the-anti> Duffster, not all of it :)
<skezz> falter:  Why don't you get off of your lazt ass, brush off the cheeto's, and enlist
<skezz> eh?
<praxis9> Upside my goat humper. Unto the end!
<plusplusC> Pickle: In some ways Bush is very clever, in some ways very dumb.  I do think he's been underestimated by his foes, but his fans also fail to see his weaknesses.

<skezz> yea ... what I thought
<falter> skezz: how bout i just put you on ignore instead, mm'kay?
<Duffster> the-anti, ok, i admit, wasnt alive then

<skezz> arm chair generals =D
<skezz> got to love em
<falter> ok where was i
<Chindogg> (falter): that's kinda hard to plan around, usually you plan for being behind schedule, no way ahead of it.
<falter> man.. wesley clark has this "Man I'm glad I'm not involved in this" look in his eyes
<Pickle> And as far as I'm concerned he's the only leader I answer to.  Fuck a Chretien and a Canada for that matter.

<Duffster> marlborooooooooooooo hahah
<Duffster> hahaha
<MeatHook> Duffster: we have over 700K left to send
<MeatHook> I doubt the draft will be re-instated
<Duffster> MeatHook, i dont know, seriously
<ThinIcer> Duffster: oh...if it is, public support for the war would take about a 75 point dive
<Duffster> MeatHook, i dont know, seriously, if the arab news boobs dont START to be objective, i dont know
<MeatHook> we have over a million volunteers... even if some of them were just using it as a scholarship program
<MeatHook> and I don't think that manpower will be the deciding factor
<Duffster> see, all you Vietnamists need to educate the rest of us who never lived through that...
<|bob> Rumsfeld is quite opposed to the draft
<MeatHook> willpower will
<|bob> at least now
<|bob> he said it wasn't a very efficient way to build up an army
<MeatHook> no, it isn't

<plusplusC> bob: probably as much because he has contempt for the quality of protoplasm that's netted by a draft, as for the political calculations.  If you can get by without a draft, you get better quality soldiers
<Duffster> ^^Dir, cnn is irrelevant, their ratings keep plummetting
<Fazze> I live in a country with draft... I almost went to jail cos I'm too lazy to do military service.... but they put me in the reserve. (all 18 year old men in Sweden have to go through a 2 day evaluation. then the military pick the best ones...)
<^^Dir> Duffster: who's ratings?
<Duffster> Fazze, hmmmmmmm
<MeatHook> we all have to register for selective service as well
<Duffster> MeatHook, MEN ONLY, women option to register
<|bob> drafts lead to situations like apocalypse now

<Duffster> MeatHook, thats gonna change IF a draft is reinstated
<yoyo^> aloha
<Duffster> MeatHook, amen
<yoyo^> only women bleed
<falter> meathook: why do you think that?
<yoyo^> unless your shot
<Fazze> women should do nothing, except bounche off the fist between the bed and kitchen. *evil grin*
<yoyo^> oh boy !

<Duffster> meathook, when men see women suffer, it is instincts, no?
<the-anti> That would be the reason for the Russian troops in Iran
<MeatHook> but seriously... men are more likely to do something stupid and against regulation to save a woman from potential capture and sexual torture than a man
<falter> women supposedly have a better pain threshold than men

<|bob> duffster: if you watched Spielberg's "Schindler's List" you might get the notion that the Nazi guards supervising Schindler's plant didn't bother the Jews because they were under orders from Schindler. Actually, the guards outranked the the factory owners, but Schindler allowed workers to carry guns on the factory floor. Spielberg doesn't mention this.

<Telal> Try to expose yourself to a wide variety of propaganda - then you might end up somewhere near the truth.
<moreon> tttwisted: i wonder why thats even a news story. its my understanding that lightning hits airplanes a lot of times, and nothing happens of it
<|bob> Saddam's ideology is arab nationalism with himself at the center
<TimothyWT> Nena chick got a picture of her?
<tttwisted> moreon: i was just going to ask that, if its common
<DStewart> It is. They're built to take it.

<DStewart> IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW Reports of alll those Republican Guards headed toward our troops south of Baghdad have been debunked. 
<Telal> No - because there aren't any Islamic ministers. :)

<DStewart> SO I guess it should be shut down.
<Shoot2Kil> they are pobably trying to surround the 3-7
<JonEFever> It almost seems we are willing to exchange some casualties so that we won't win in a decisive manner
<Fazze> they said bridges in baghdad have been wired with explosives
<the-anti> Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
<JonEFever> yeah i think they want to blow the bridges when they release the chem so we can't escape them
<Fazze> I wouldn't wanna see Us forces trapped in baghdad, bridges blown. no airsupport, and iraqi forces turning up from the desert

<GREATGUY> ?
<GREATGUY> can you explain that...
<Shoot2Kil> why wouldn't they have air support?
<Fazze> Shoot2Kil: close airsupport, can be downed with RPG's and AA guns 
<PanthrKub> hello all
<IamKing> Fazze:  hard to take an A-10 down with an RPG   :
<JonEFever> soften the areas with b-52's then bring in the a-10's and copters to clean up
<IamKing> other planes though, that would be foolish to use as air support
<GREATGUY> what's this about: Drowned Marines in full gear; Entered water wearing heavy battle outfits and weapons.
<Fazze> Yeaaaaaaah.. but A-10 isn't all that great in a city...
<IamKing> that's what an Apache is for

<GREATGUY> yeah..on drudge
<GREATGUY> no link yet
<Shoot2Kil> ?
<|BamBam|> actuallly
<|BamBam|> an AC-130 is best for tactical fire support in a city
<|BamBam|> it has a long loiter time
<|BamBam|> and plenty of firepower
<Fazze> yeah it's a sweet machine
<GREATGUY> what news service has the most up-to-date info..?
<PanthrKub> AP :)
<|meteor|> 3Abusive domain or user
<PanthrKub> or did you want accurate?
<Shoot2Kil> cnn didn't say anything about drowning
<JonEFever> yes i've seen a 130 gunship turn a truck into  fragment of metal no bigger than your hand
<Swigert> hey hey!
<tttwisted> fox reported the republican guard marching out of bagdad. http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,82206,00.html
<Fazze> fox off
<^rcane> heh a c130 as a gunship?
<spange> anyone understand the column
<^rcane> holy shit!
<^rcane> run!
<IamKing> rcane:  yeah, was mainly used by special forces primarily
<PanthrKub> C-130 rollin down the strip...
<IamKing> but it's a big pregnant yak with wings
<^rcane> IamKing: damn, if you see that coming, you are already dead
<JonEFever> literal wall of ammunition
<IamKing> and not necessarily a flying tank like the A-10 is
<US-Male`> that thing has huge Gatlin-style machine guns
<US-Male`> it wipes out all kind of shit
<IamKing> A-10 has the best gun
<Fazze> one C130 gunship was lost in afganistan, and one i the last gulf war. If i'm not mistaken... guess they are a bit too easy to bring down after all
<IamKing> period
<JonEFever> not much armour
<IamKing> end of story
<IamKing> Fazze:  exactly
<|BamBam|> http://www.af.mil/news/factsheets/AC_130H_U_Gunship.html
<^rcane> well they can beef up the armor
<^rcane> i mean using a c130 as a gunship? fuck
<IamKing> rcane:  they could try
<^rcane> take some weapons off, put some more armor on
<US-Male`> I think it's AC130 
<IamKing> and they probably already did anyway
<|bob> Fox is always one step ahead of the facts
<US-Male`> isn't it?
<RustyFord> Puff the magic dragon
<Swigert> fazze: they do need air supremacy to operate, but when they get it they can be devastating.  They were used on covert ops in Central America in the 80s
<^rcane> yea usmale
<RustyFord> *Burp* 1000 dead
<IamKing> but it's still not as damage tolerant as an A-10
<^rcane> attack c130

<RustyFord> they used to use those in Nam, big ass gatlin's mounted on the side of a c-130 hehe

<IamKing> US-Male:  we lost one in Afghanistan near the beginning of that conflict
<PanthrKub> yes
<Fazze> near pakistani border
<CometBaby> bob .. the last report I heard on it, they said it had not been in use for a couple of years and that they would know more after it had been inspected.
<IamKing> lost 8 lives there
<IamKing> iirc
<ScuZzy160> hmm.. why ?
<TimothyWT> ScuZzy160 : I care

<RustyFord> see what happens when you let a woman drive=P
<^rcane> baghdad now looks like new york
<IamKing> wasn't really a high-performance plane, but it had just about as many polyons as an A-10 does...but I don't think it can take as much damage as an A-10 though
<^rcane> you like that saddam?
<ScuZzy160> ok, but if it means us taking heavier casualties, you'd still be against it ?
<the-anti> There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
<|bob> "Burdened under the weight of Kalashnikov rifles, sweating  and often fainting  under the scorching sun in their all-black uniforms, the lads go through three-week training courses in light weapons training, hand-to-hand combat and basic soldiering, accompanied by a shrill political indoctrination that pledges absolute loyalty to their leader."
<|bob> "They are the Ashbal Saddam, or Saddam's Lion Cubs. These cadres of Iraqi boys, aged between 12 and 17, are trained along the lines of the Hitler Youth."

<CometBaby> What I cannot get over .. are these cam scenes from ..Baghdad and the cars are out on the perfectly intact highways and streets and nobody seems very concerned.
<PanthrKub> too stupid or too unequiped

<Shoot2Kil> they want to be martyred

<PanthrKub> hmm.. wag the dog
<CometBaby> Thin its very, very dangerous .. if one of our missiles do go awry .. its gonna be bad news
<PanthrKub> oh, they should walk? to.. where? iran? turkey? saudi arabia? qatar?
<ThinIcer> CometBaby: war is always bad news
<Gryzor> uhm, your missiled DID comet.
<Gryzor> 14 dead yesterday in a marketplace, 100's wounded
<JonEFever> pfft.. they're already saying we are targetting civilians
<CometBaby> thin they are over confident that we will be able to pinpoint everything
<US-Male`> "At the heart of their arsenal is an M102 105mm cannon which, in the Spooky version, can fire six to ten rounds a minute. The AC130U Spooky also has a 25mm Gatling gun which can fire 1,800 rounds a minute"

<US-Male`> that is a cool aircraft
<PanthrKub> I see.
<ScuZzy160> you may be too uppity for using your own legs though
<CometBaby> Gryzor .. I am not convinced of that.  It is the claim from the Saddam puppets .. that doesn't make it true.
<PanthrKub> what?
<ScuZzy160> but that's how they're getting out of Basrah
<PanthrKub> sorry I dont think they should talk to a country that hates them, my bad
<PanthrKub> walk either
<US-Male`> it doesn't matter that "they" say
<CometBaby> there are new explosions taking place in areas that we are not targeting and have not had missles anywhere near.
<US-Male`> we know the deal
<CometBaby> It is exactly the sort of the thing Saddam would do.
<|bob> scuzzy: 3rd world countries have private bus operators
<panini> oh, this is disturbing... Saddam is apparently giving guns to small children and telling them to fire them at US soldiers

<ScuZzy160> it doesn't matter who is behind the gun
<ScuZzy160> you take it out
<US-Male`> it slightly matters -- they have been programmed

<ScuZzy160> US-Male: who there hasn't been ?

<CometBaby> heh
<|bob> like I said, the hard part of this war is going to be in Tikrit
<Fazze> Flame throwers is not used enough in modern warfare. :(
<US-Male`> if not he may offer a warning
<panini> 9 more marines died in house-to-house fighting in Nasirya
<PanthrKub> I doubt Saddam will be in Tikrit, and taking out his ancestors prolly isnt a good idea
<US-Male`> it should be totally left to the discretion of the battlefield commander
<ScuZzy160> I think one of the problems they're up against is they're trying to fight the war too PC

<PanthrKub> Gryzor: what did they say?
<Gryzor> the host asked why they thought their contrymen were fighting the US-troops
<US-Male`> each soldier should be told that nobody will question his kills
<US-Male`> and then nobody should question it
<|bob> '[An Iraqi National Congress spokesman] says he's prepared for the worst. "I have learned that Saddam is unpredictable," he says. "He has been known to use dirty tactics  what kind of dirty tactics, I can't guess and using children to defend his regime will not surprise me."'   <-- that's from a Jan. 22 report
<PanthrKub> US-Male`: the soldiers question their own kills , though
<US-Male`> unless there is serious evidence of wrongdoing
<US-Male`> PanthrKub that is fine but I don't want them to endanger their own lives
<Gryzor> apparently, saddam hussein has always said he'll "liberate" iran, "liberate" q8 etc, so bush choise of words with "liberation" didn't exactly go home.

<PanthrKub> US-Male`: true
<US-Male`> just because it's a kid behind the weapon
<RustyFord> hahahahahaha anyone see the previews for the new movie A man apart?
<the-anti> Just like North Korea wants to "unite" with South Korea and liberate them.
<PanthrKub> US-Male`: my husband is over there, he cant stand the kills
<RustyFord> he goes get the drug dog and this little chiuauau comes out of the car
<US-Male`> PanthrKub I am sure it would bother most people but it has to be done
<US-Male`> it must not be easy
<ScuZzy160> we should liberate the French from France
<Fazze> just face it. Arabs rather live under an arab tyrant, than an american cowboy. They actually believe Bush will become president over Iraq!

<dubbya> iraq had highlevel coordinator for food on 
<JonEFever> it's a friggin war
<the-anti> Acutally it's only an operation in a larger war
<US-Male`> I'm sure it would bother me a littleif I had to kill kids who were shooting at me but I would shot their asses fast when needed
<US-Male`> shot = shoot
<Fazze> shoot m in the nuts
<Thomas1> Is it true the US is getting its war news censored?
<US-Male`> I'd rather have some guilt feelings than die
<ScuZzy160> Thomas1: censored ?
<the-anti> Thomas, absolutely
<Dirk_IIV> not censored
<Fazze> Thomas1: they don't censor. they choose not to show everything
<Thomas1> Yes not getting the full story
<Dirk_IIV> the usans are free to look up what they wantt
<Shoot2Kil> wonder if saddam told the kids they might get shot back at?
<ScuZzy160> all of the embedded reporters have guidelines for what they can report and they must be cleared before reporting it
<JonEFever> if we let this regime to continue to exist it will only mean more children put in harm's way in thee future
<Thomas1> thats called censoring
<ScuZzy160> that goes for everyone
<Fazze> no
<Dirk_IIV> no it isn't
<IamKing> Thomas:  no, it's not
<Dirk_IIV> it doesn't fit your bill of what wshoould be reported
<IamKing> Thomas:  censoring is a post-production activity
<Dirk_IIV> nothing is blocked
<zzyzx> Well they have to censor some stuff - loose lips sink ships.
<PanthrKub> oh just tell the kid what he's asking
<Thomas1> Don't US citizens deserve the full story after all they are your troops
<PanthrKub> Thomas1: it's true that you're not getting the whole story
<ScuZzy160> we'll get the full story when the war is over
<PanthrKub> they want you to be patriotic
<IamKing> zzyzx:  no, the journalists know that they shouldn't cross the line...lest the military boot out said journalist
<ScuZzy160> we don't want the full story now
<Dirk_IIV> what is the def of a "full story?"
<ScuZzy160> if we get the full story so does the Iraqi regime
<Dirk_IIV> nothing is blocked
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  What makes you think you aren't getting the full story?
<Dirk_IIV> no censorship
<the-anti> If you don't like to call it censorship, manipulation might be a better term.
<PanthrKub> he isnt american
<Thomas1> Why are we here in Australia getting the full story and you are not
<US-Male`> Saddam probably told the kids that Americans are "too weak" to shoot at kids, or some such BS
<ScuZzy160> I want censorship coming out of those embedded reporters
<PanthrKub> because they want us to believe whatever they tell us, and it needs to be pro america
<US-Male`> "you're doing the work of Allah" etc etc
<JonEFever> I wonder if we used some knock-out gas on the masses of advancing enemies/civilians, if we'd then get assailed by the left for using chemical weapons
<IamKing> Thomas1:  I don't need to know every stinking detail of what's going on there...the amount of information we're getting is unprecidented due to such open access that the military is giving us now
<TheTailor> JonEFever:  Of course we would
<ScuZzy160> I'm not always comfortable with how much info they are giving away as it is
<Dirk_IIV> nothing is blocked
<Dirk_IIV> your lame details may be neglected
<PanthrKub> notice that the news from bbc.co.uk is not like cnn.com
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  What makes you think you aren't getting the full story?
<Dirk_IIV> insignificant
<ScuZzy160> it seems like the news is about the same
<Thomas1> The pictures of your soldiers being captured was delayed for some time
<ScuZzy160> from those 2
<PanthrKub> he is getting the full story, thats his point, hes australian
<PanthrKub> idiot.
<ScuZzy160> BBC and CNN are both anti-american
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  Oh?  How long?
<the-anti> A lot of what they allow to 'leak' is obviously disinformation in an attempt to mislead the enemy.
<ScuZzy160> we already know this
<IamKing> Thomas1:  delay and not showing at all are 2 different things
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  How long was the delay?
<IamKing> we have next of kin code of conduct that we need to inform the kin of the captured or dead FIRST before they find out about it on the news
<Thomas1> It was because other networks world wide showed the pictures
<ScuZzy160> so what news are we supposedly not getting ?
<IamKing> it's called common courtesy
<JonEFever> you wanna see more of the blowing sand?
<PanthrKub> Thomas1: there are many books on the subject, dont get your information from people on irc who have probably never been to college :)
<US-Male`> IamKing that is exactly it
<Fazze> with 300,000 sons,daughters, father, moms over there. the full story isn't always the best interest for the home audience, no need to show all brutal sides of war. everyone can imagine what goes on anyway
<IamKing> Thomas1:  that's because it wasn't THEIR troops
<ScuZzy160> because US news agencies refused to show the executed POWs ?
<Fazze> or watch al jazeera
<US-Male`> they have to wait a day or say to notify the relatives
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  Austrailia's news services could have shown the bad stuff if they wished...
<US-Male`> then it goes on the news
<US-Male`> a day or so, I mean
<Thomas1> Aussie news did show the pics
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  You got Al Jezeera...they showed the shit...what do you want?
<PanthrKub> TheTailor: you are missing the point, he's asking why here in america our news is censored
<Gryzor> .... and that's the right thing to do
<Gryzor> that's not called censoring, that's called common sense.
<US-Male`> yeah they don't have to wait there
<Dirk_IIV> i've been trying to get the a-jazeera vido
<Gryzor> good thing the media atleast respect that
<JonEFever> Brave Iraqi warriors hiding behind women and old men

<PanthrKub> he is saying that it is not censored in australia
<ThinIcer> news agencies didn't have a problem showing pictures to the public of the bodies of American servicemen being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu
<Thomas1> I believe the Al jezeera site has been blocked
<Dirk_IIV> its not available in britain
<ScuZzy160> its not even "common sense" its just GOOD TASTE
<US-Male`> American media waits until the relatives are told
<TheTailor> PanthrKub:  I asked him why he thinks that, he saqid it was because of the delay in seeing something.
<TheTailor> PanthrKub:  And if he saw it in Austrailia...what does he care if CNN runs it or not?
<Dirk_IIV> or france
<Dirk_IIV> or anywhere
<PanthrKub> o dear
<PanthrKub> goodnight everybody
<Dirk_IIV> what do you call censorship?
<Shoot2Kil> the red cross are attempting to arrange a visit with the pow's
<the-anti> It's not like tainted and errant news is some sort of new thing
<JonEFever> The image of Saddam's faithful cowering behind a woman in order to get a good shot would be a valuble tool
<Thomas1> sorry check both french and UK sites
<ScuZzy160> all US news outfits criticised foreign news for airing the dead POW video
<Shoot2Kil> how long should that take?
<US-Male`> nobody "needs"  to know on the same day unless they are related to the dead
<US-Male`> it's arrogant to demand to know before the relatives
<JonEFever> Gingrich said tonight the coalition ought to go to the UN, Al Jazeera and the French and have them beseech the Iraqis to evacuate all civilians from Baghdad and other target areas within 3 days
--- Starting response with 'days'
--- Responding: 'days of mass destruction, and rape '
<dubbya> days of mass destruction, and rape 
<the-anti> The fact that the news keeps repeating that they're now going to attack from a northern front leads me to believe that they're going to attack from the west.
<zzyzx>  Why should Al Jezeera be blocked? I think it is being blocked by some rw wacks geeks.
<ScuZzy160> US media has a much higher standard than media outside of the US
<Dirk_IIV> if the network execs can see it then anyone should be able to
<Dirk_IIV> no diss to the relatives
<ScuZzy160> not releasing the names of dead before first of kin in notified is one of those standards
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV:  that's illogical, someone has to run the network
<US-Male`> therefore that is not relevant
<IamKing> lol...al Jazeera claimed that their English-translated web site was DoS'd by US hackers   ;)
<Thomas1> Scuzzy I just believe your media is under pressure from above not to tell the full story good or bad
<IamKing> I saw that in my local paper today...heheheh
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: not illogical at all
<TheTailor> ScuZzy160:  CNN showed the film of the situation in Somalia...
<US-Male`> of course it is
<Dirk_IIV> why should connie chung be able to filter anyone?
<ThinIcer> IamKing: I wonder how many of our high-speed connects were used in that
<IamKing> Thomas:  no, they're under pressure to not tell details about where exactly they are when the military is on the move
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  Why would you believe that?
<Dirk_IIV> no diss to chung
<US-Male`> whether or not a network guy sees it (unavoidable) has no bearing on whether we should the relatives hearing it on CNN before they get the phone call 
<|bob> Connie Chung is gone
<|bob> Ding dong, the bimbo's gone!
<US-Male`> the point is to prevent them hearing it first on CNN if they are related to the dead guy
<Thomas1> They can report bad news without giving details of where various units are operating
<IamKing> ThinIcer:  I don't know, but they claim they were flooded
<US-Male`> they are supposed to hear it from a personal call
<the-anti> Perhaps some relatives would prefer knowing about it now rather than waiting for the official visit
<US-Male`> perhaps the sky will fall
<US-Male`> but it won't
<|bob> let's hope she doesn't make another comeback
<Dirk_IIV> then the net execs shoouldn't be allowed to see it either
<TheTailor> Thomas1:  You never heard of operational security did you?
<Pickle> Commie Dung takes "media whore" to a new nadir.
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV:  illogical, that is unavoidable
<Dirk_IIV> thousands of citizens have higher rights than network execs
<IamKing> TheTailor:  apparently not   ;)
<Fazze> why give out the names at all?
<Pickle> It's not often you watch someone sell their soul on national television to get the scoop.
<US-Male`> that is who makes the decision of what airs
<ThinIcer> IamKing: that's what a DoS usually is, involving thousands of net connects all connecting to the same site at once
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: no it is not
<Fazze> what's the point
<ThinIcer> in unison
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: don't let anyone see it
<ThinIcer> many people have their cable modems and DSLs hijacked and used unknowingly in such an attack
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV:  yes, it is and it doens't matter how many times you say it
<Thomas1> Sorry you are just misunderstanding what I am trying to say. Just get your media to inform US people fully
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: ugo
<US-Male`> that s impossible, SOMEONE has to see it to know it exists
<US-Male`> jesus, use your brain
<the-anti> DoS's can be done without even hijacking a single connection
<Dirk_IIV> but what u are saying is ineffective
<US-Male`> it is not known to exist until someone sees it
<JonEFever> The media criticizes the public for having the attention span of a 2 year old, but they are showing that it's they who have the short attention span
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: use yours
<ThinIcer> the-anti: I didn't say it was limited in scope
<US-Male`> Dirk:  shut up, dumbass
<IamKing> Thomas:  how much more info do we really need to know?  start providing some examples
<US-Male`> I am done talking to an idiot
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: make me
<US-Male`> lol
<Dirk_IIV> twerp
<US-Male`> wimp
<MrRod> Who's the twerp?
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`
<Dirk_IIV> let's go, bro
<Dirk_IIV> your face will hurt tomorrow
<the-anti> They just send requests to thousands of servers, forged to appear to come from the victim, and the thousands of servers try to respond
<US-Male`> this dumb fag claims that "nobody"  including TV personnel should see a video of a dead soldier if his relatives haven't been told -- When in FACT, it is not known to exist until someone sees it
<Dirk_IIV> dust farter
<US-Male`> once somebody sees it then it is know to exist
<MrRod> Dirk_IIV:  "Let's go, bro"?  This isn't that kind of channel.
<US-Male`> therefore it is not avoidable
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV:  try a gay channel
<Dirk_IIV> if the network execs can see it, everyone should be able to
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV is a pillowbiter
<MrRod> Dirk_IIV:  See what?
<Dirk_IIV> it was a fighting comment
<US-Male`> yeah, just repeat the same idiotic statement
<Thomas1> If the rest of the world can see it why not you
<Dirk_IIV> that's obvious
<US-Male`> so then you are a homo but you're not here for that
<Dirk_IIV> why do you bring up sex?
<US-Male`> lol
<Dirk_IIV> u fucking faggot
<US-Male`> you did
<moreon> US-Male: why don't you take your insecurities elsewhere
<US-Male`> moreon: why don't you eat shit and die
<the-anti> Well, the media has the right to report or not report whatever they want, but the viewers have the duty to boycott the advertisers if they don't like the media station's tactics.
<moreon> whats with all the gay-baiting that goes on in this channel
<US-Male`> moreon is a good name for you
<Dirk_IIV> i have few
<Dirk_IIV> keep trying
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV is not gay... but his boyfriend is !
<IamKing> moreon:  it's penis envy   ;)
<MrRod> Dirk_IIV:  Hey, I didn't bring it up.  I didn't even mention sex.  What's on your mind, huh?
<Dirk_IIV> ugo wuss
<US-Male`> Dirk I heard you got fired from the local sperm bank, for drinking on the job
<US-Male`> "ugo"  has no meaning, dumbass
<Fazze> HAAAAAAAAAHaaaaaa
<the-anti> That's why you see so many drug commercials during the news, because they're a "safe" advertisement since people generally are too stupid to realize that they don't need prescription drugs.
<Thomas1> Suddenly the subjects have become boring
<Dirk_IIV> if the network execs can see it, everyone should be able to
<Dirk_IIV> that's obvious
<US-Male`> Dirk_IIV takes "alpha-male lessons" from Richard Simmons
<MrRod> So what do you guys think of Iraq executing US POWs?
<Dirk_IIV> dig your hole deeper
<moreon> Dirk_IIV: networks have policies. someone needs to enforce those policies. that falls to the network execs.
<US-Male`> The best sex Dirk_IIV ever had, was when his finger broke through the toilet paper.
<Fazze> Richard "Fuck my Ass and call me a Bitch" Simmons?
<Mikey^> not sure
<the-anti> MrRod, optimistically, at least they're not being tortured.
<Mikey^> I think Saddam must die
<Dirk_IIV> no need for my help
<MrRod> Man, can't you two take it to a private channel?
<Mikey^> he killed over 30,000 Kurds
<MrRod> the-anti:  We don't know that.
<US-Male`> no he's too gay
<the-anti> MrRod, hard to torture a dead person
<MrRod> the-anti:  You do it before killing them.
<zzyzx> GWB and GB killed 200K.
<Mikey^> now something else, Russia-Washington honeymoon is over, Bush called Putin and accused him of selling illegal weapons to Irak
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: i'll see u at the store sometime
<Dirk_IIV> u won't say shit
<US-Male`> lol
<Thomas1> Yeah and Saddam has lots & lots of oil
<US-Male`> wimp

<US-Male`> Dirk:  does your ass hurt every day ?
<US-Male`> from all that buttfucking ?
<Dirk_IIV> yoour daughters does
<US-Male`> lol
<Mikey^> lol
<US-Male`> I don't have kids, you retard
<Pickle> A dozen Albertans have pooled their cash to buy a full-page ad in USA today supporting the war.
<Politiks> Does anyone know where I can find that quote from Dacschle a few years back where he recommends that we attack Saddam
<Politiks> I love Alberta
<Mikey^> I do have a problem walking for a couple of days, but that's because I train my legs hard ;-)
<zzyzx> I don't know why anyone would not want to be an environmentalist.
<Politiks> zzyzx: Because it's based on quacky science most of the time
<Mikey^> hmm
<ScuZzy160> the-anti: that's right, or more striking, what about termites who create more o-zone destroying methane than anything else on the planet...
<Fazze> please be quiet
<the-anti> No matter what humans do, it's nature.
<US-Male`> Dirk:  but your mom is the sluttiest welfare queen around
<Dirk_IIV> brutally
<Pickle> http://www.wesupporttheusa.ca/
<US-Male`> she screws for a $5 foodstamp
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: you'rew thinking about your ass
<ScuZzy160> zzyzx: environmentalism is all based on junk science to support an anti-capitalist, anti-progress agenda
<Politiks> Come on. Help me find that quote by Daschle where he says basically the opposite of what he says now
<MrRod> Pickle:  Is that your web page?
<the-anti> Politiks, what does he say now?
<US-Male`> Dirk is just mad because his trailer park  evicted him for being a boy whore
<Pickle> MrRod, nope
<Politiks> that bush is a diplomatic failure
--- Starting response with 'failure'
--- Responding: 'failure to plan, as damage tolerant as well musk ox, moose, and it '
<dubbya> failure to plan, as damage tolerant as well musk ox, moose, and it 
<ScuZzy160> you think you are so smart, and yet you don't even see you've been duped into buying into unsupported junk science
<Solon> Iraqi TV has managed to stay on the air despite having virtually no resources left and no programs to put on. Kind of like ABC. 
--- Starting response with 'abc'
--- Responding: 'commie dung takes away millions of the important job is that war, the test '
<dubbya> commie dung takes away millions of the important job is that war, the test 
<the-anti> I try not to hear Daschle, his voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: shut your ass
<zzyzx> Politiks: What wacky science.  There is no anti-capitalist agenda.  Environmentalist have 3 story houses drive large cars, own several acres, like to hunting and fishing.
<Dirk_IIV> that's the only orifice you ever let talk
<US-Male`> Dirk:  go blow your boyfriend
<ScuZzy160> the-anti: but he is always so concerned..!
<ScuZzy160> he has serious questions...
<US-Male`> Dirk:  wipe your chin,  queerboy
<Dirk_IIV> whoa
<ScuZzy160> but for all of Dascle's serious questions, has anyone ever heard a serious answer from hm ?
<Solon> Good gossip: At the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, Tim Robbins came up to this Washington Post reporter and told him if he ever wrote about his family again he would hunt him down. In fact, he would have beat him up right there but he had to leave early to go to a peace rally. 
<the-anti> zzyzx, yep which is why they are hypocritical.  
<Politiks> Exactly zzyzx: They are hypocrites
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: why the sex chat?
<^rcane> tim robbins?isnt he married to his mother?
<Dirk_IIV> go to #gayshit
<US-Male`> Dirk:  it only seems like sex chat becasue you're gay
<zzyzx> not hypocritical, reasonable and sustainable.
<US-Male`> Dirk:  those are called "insults"
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: not really
<US-Male`> are you an op on #gayshit ?
<Politiks> yes. Susan Sarandon
<US-Male`> I knew it
<Mikey^> lol
<Pickle> MrRod, as surprising as it may be, there are parts of Canada that are ultra-conservative.  Alberta has been governed by the Conservatives for over 30 years now.
<MrRod> Pickle;  Did you read about the woman who joined the US Army to be an army cook but now she's a prisoner of war in Iraq?  An unexpected turn of events for her.
--- Starting response with 'her'
--- Responding: 'her will question you know '
<dubbya> her will question you know 
<zzyzx> environmentalists don't believe in property taxes or building permits, but large areas of raw land.
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`: why keep bringing      it up?/
<the-anti> Where do environmentalists proposed to find the energy to fuel large cars, heat and cool three-story houses, and mow several acres?
<US-Male`> this queer is trying to get me to his little gay channel
<Solon> It happened again. This time a woman on Long Island is accused of running over her husband with her minivan. Apparently that Texas flu is spreading to the rest of the country now. 
<Politiks> MrRod: Yes I saw that. That is the reason women should never be allowed to go into combat
<Pickle> Lots of people, including the Premier, publicly support the war and also publicly call Chretien an asshole for opposing it.
<Politiks> I heard that joke yesterday solon
<Dirk_IIV> US-Male`can't even get gay sex
<Politiks> was that conan or jay?
<bratton> Solon:  not even a Mercedes M-class SUV?
<MrRod> Pickle:  Yes, I realize there are conservative parts of Canada.  There are also conservative parts of California but a lot of people don't know that either.
<Dirk_IIV> ur are a total lewser dude
<^rcane> why would anyone want gay sex?
<MrRod> Politiks:  I would make the same comment if it was a man.
<US-Male`> Dirk has herpes on his asscheeks
<Fazze> Arian Killer machine
<Dirk_IIV> ask US-Male`
<^rcane> how does us-male know this?
<Solon> Politiks did you heard this:According to the Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine, the more female friends you have, the less likely you are to have a heart attack. Unless of course your wife catches you with one of your female friends. Then your chances quadruple! Your chance of getting hit by a minivan triple! 
<Swigert> hey
<Politiks> Haha
<US-Male`> well ya see, Dirk was raped by a priest
<bratton> lol Solon
<zzyzx> the-anti: With 50 percent less people, no immigration, geothermal, photovoltaic, papercrete, cement.
<Politiks> That was Jay Leno
<MrRod> ^rcane:  They're gay lovers.  
<Politiks> now i remember
<Fazze> that not even fun
<US-Male`> that';s how it all started
<^rcane> MrRod: explains a lot
<US-Male`> MrRod is jealous
<Politiks> Why are liberals so in favor of immigration? Doesn't that hurt the environment to have all those excess people in our country?
<bratton> Politiks:  shhh, don't tell them
<Swigert> they don't support immigtation - they support immigrants
<Politiks> sorry swigert
<Politiks> they love immigration
<Solon> Over the weekend Tiger Woods won his latest tournament by 11 strokes even though he was sick and threw up several times while playing. Even more impressive was that he threw up on a spectator that was 300 yards away. 
<Dirk_IIV> thhe libs were actually more in favor of border tighteninggg
<Politiks> Ok Solon: We saw Jay Leno last night
<Politiks> Quit pulling off quotes from newsmax.com
<Dirk_IIV> reps like the mnexicans
<Swigert> politiks: how dare you question me - you right wing fascist! ;)
<Solon> Politiks that was Conan
<zzyzx> Politiks: I guess some do, but they are misguided.  Most would support a balanced population.
<Fazze> Solon, my dead grandfather can pull off jokes funnier than that
<Solon> Fazze you forgot to say Horray!
<Politiks> I think it's time we try supporting the population we do have. I mean there will never be a time of zero unemployment so why keep letting in more people to take our jobs
<Fazze> got damn I'm bored. SHow me the Nukes!
<zzyzx> Politiks: I don't support immigration of any kind, $10 million a head.
<hashbar> balls deep
<hashbar> $10 million a head does mean you support immigration
<hashbar> just at the right price
<Pickle> MrRod, in the case of Alberta, we're talking about an entire province.  It would be like California being conservative.  Laugh.
<Politiks> i really think it's time this country end immigration
<the-anti> Producing solar cells requires more energy than they produce throughout their duration of existence.  I'm not sure about geothermal energy, but I haven't seen much more than passing mention of it so I doubt it has progressed to a useful level.  I am surprised you didn't mention wind power and hydrogen because they will probably be the most viable alternative fuel within 10 years...
<Dirk_IIV> immigrants don't mind swinginng hammers
<zzyzx> Politiks: I agree and each person coming in takes an 5 acres in food and fibre.  That is why Bono makes me sick, give all this money to Africa so twice as many people can be in misery 10 years from now, meanwhile take out the last of the remaining wildlife.
<Fazze> nuke them
<MrRod> Pickle:  California elected Ronald Reagan as governor at one time.
<Fazze> plz
<MrRod> Pickle:  But that was a different era.
<Pickle> MrRod, we've elected Ronald Reagans for the last 30 years.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Most of California, geographically speaking, is conservative.
<Politiks> I really think the best idea is for Americans to emigrate to Africa. That would certainly bring up Africa's standard of living. The way it is now the best people from each country leave for America and their country of origin remains crappy
<MrRod> Pickle:  Cities on the coast are the liberal centers.
<zzyzx> the-anti: trust me that is not true, it takes 1-3 years to pay the energy debt.  Panels are warranted 30 years, and they don't wear out, expect them to last 100,200 years.
<MrRod> Pickle:  The cities on the coast are big enough to swamp California politics.
<bratton> MrRod:  it's fairly conservative here in Thousand Oaks, CA
<zzyzx> Politiks: I totally agree, a powerful nation has more people leave than coming in.
<Fazze> all western factories have been moved to China and south-east asia anyway so whatta fuck... time to give up, and nuke at least half the world.
<the-anti> I am sure there will be some innovations with solar cells in the next few years, too.  But right now it's still cheaper to stay on the grid in most cases.
<Pickle> MrRod, well, I live in the only leftwing haven in Alberta
<Pickle> The rest of the province is solidly rightwing
<zzyzx> the-anti - austrialia is building a 9 square mile solar thermal plant to give electricity for 200,000 homes.  No photovoltaics or mirrors.
<Fazze> can't have a factory in a radioactive zone *hint hint* :)
<MrRod> Pickle:  So you live in the only real city?
<Politiks> Pickle: I hope your secession movement is successful
<MrRod> Not that Alberta has 'real' cities.
<Politiks> Edmonton and Calgary: Heard of em?
<Mikey^> Alberta is the ghetto
<the-anti> zzyzx, interesting, will have to read into that.  BTW, England and Ireland are both also building windfarms that are equivalent to a nuclear power plant
<Pickle> MrRod, Calgary is just as big, maybe slightly larger, and its extremely rightwing.
<Swigert> calgary has nearly 1 million people
<MrRod> Funny thing.  They need more people from Ontario to move there.
<Pickle> MrRod, in fact all of southern alberta, the most heavily populated region of the province, is rightwing.  Southwest Alberta even scares me.
<Swigert> Ontario is the only place with ghettos
<Solon> windfarms are not equivalent to nuclear power plants...
<zzyzx> bratton: California is weird politically San diego votes like 75% repo, while LA county it is 60 percent demo.  Thousand Oaks is a nice place but Oxnard/Port Hueneme is scary.
<MrRod> 1 million people?  I guess that's a lot for western Canada.
<Mikey^> lol
<the-anti> Solon, they are when they produce 500-1,000 Mega Watts of power.
<MrRod> Pickle:  You're scared by Canadians?
<Pickle> Well, the whole population is just under three million
<Swigert> ALbertans are not Canadians
<Pickle> MrRod, ever watch "deliverance"?
<Mikey^> Albertans are traitors
<Politiks> San Francisco votes 99% Democrat. That 1% goes for Michael Savage and a few of his friends
<Pickle> Squeal, pig.
<bratton> zzyzx:  that's true.  of course, when the median home is priced at around a half-million, it's bound to be better  ;)
<MrRod> Pickle:  Yes.
<Mikey^> they're perpretators of crimes
<MrRod> Pickle:  Oh, come on.
<Solon> the anti you need windfarm with the size of california to produce that
<MrRod> Pickle:  It can't be that bad!
<Pickle> MrRod, no shit.  Think rural Montana.
<Pickle> Exact same country, exact same people.
<the-anti> Solon, no, just a few square miles, and they're building them out in the ocean.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Ok.  Rednecks galore.
<Pickle> The border is just a formality.
<Fazze> windfarms give like 10%  more than they use... pointless ugly, pieces of crap
<Shoot2Kil> if the UN was on the take for commision money from the food for oil program and thus "paid off" by saddam thereby having a vested interest in there not being any change made to iraq, the do not deserve another dime and should not be allowed to collect another dime...but they will because they are just as corrupt 
<Solon> the-anti windfarms are not equivalent to nuclear power plants cope with that
<the-anti> A couple hundred separate windmills, each producing 2.5 Mega Watts
<Swigert> pickle: it should not exist
<panini> ews?
<Dirk_IIV> winndfarms are good, but it takes a lot of them
<Solon> the-anti you suppose to find energy source that can provide cities not just one building
<zzyzx> bratton: I don't think it works that way, as the  businesses start to hire illegals to bypass paying good wages.  Things will get worse.  I live in the Valley and thats what happened here.
<the-anti> Solon, 300 2.5 Mega Watt windmills will provide power for about 300,000 people.
<MrRod> Pickle:  So you wouldn't go on a solo backpacking trip through that part of Alberta?
<Politiks> Oh Canada, the USA stands on guard for thee!
<Pickle> MrRod, not if I were black.
<Pickle> Or an indian.
<Swigert> Ontario is willing to throw people in jail for the lamest things: Selling grain without the permission of the government, owning a satellite dish, failure to tell the government you own a gun
<MrRod> Pickle:  But you aren't so you're safe, right?
<Pickle> Especially not if I were an indian.
<Politiks> Mr. Chretien branded Albertans a "different" kind of
<Politiks> Canadian, and confessed he would rather do business with people from Central
<Politiks> and Eastern Canada
<Pickle> MrRod, pretty much.
<Politiks> How the hell does Canada let a French guy rule them?
<Dirk_IIV> heh
<Solon> the anti again you need big areas to build efficient windfarms 
<Dirk_IIV> go figure
<Swigert> politiks: because Ontario wants to
<zzyzx> the-anti -  the austrial idea is unique it has no water a tower sits in a circle of collectors.  The air goes to the center and out the top.  No moving parts except the turbine.
<the-anti> The main problem with wind and solar is that we're at the mercy of the weather, but that's where hydrogen "batteries" will come in handy
<MrRod> Swigert faces Ontario when he prays.
<Politiks> I believe it's time the rest of Canada secede from Quebec!!!!!!
<Swigert> mrrod: not a chance
<the-anti> Solon, again, they are building them in the ocean.  Ocean covers 70% of the surface of the earth.
<Solon> the anti and what about the energy it takes to use deliver the windfarms energy output from the ocean ever thought about that?
<Pickle> MrRod, although the parts of that country you wouldn't want to be a lone black guy or indian in aren't exactly backpacking country.  More like ranchland.
<bratton-> re
<zzyzx> Swigert: Thats what happens in a non-environmental state.  Popiulation rises, politians and city workers that don't work take over.
<MrRod> Pickle:  They sound so un-Canadian.
<the-anti> Solon, I am sure the engineers have covered that aspect as well.  Honestly I'm not sure how they're going to do that.
<Mikey^> Russia-France-Canada-Germany new coalition
<Pickle> MrRod, Alberta has more in common culturally, economically, and geographically with Texas than with any Canadian province.
<NicDanger> Pickle, Texas has culture?
<Politiks> Canada MUST secede from Quebec.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Another flatland of shoot 'em up cowboys?
<bratton> Pickle:  do they raise cattle in Alberta?
<Solon> the-anti as for now there isnt efficient method to effectily use that energy you still have to deliver the energy putput to the customers in the old ways
<the-anti> But it would even be possible to put windfarms all over North/South Dakota, Wyoming, Nevada, etc. where there are thousands of square miles of basically otherwise useless land.
<Pickle> bratton, bigtime.
<Dirk_IIV> canada must suceed frooom texass
<bratton> Pickle:  how about country music?  :)
<Pickle> MrRod, in the southern half of the province, anyway.
<Pickle> bratton, yep
<Fazze> british centcom
<MrRod> Pickle:  If you buy beef in the grocery store is it marked "Canadian Beef"?
<zzyzx> Mikey^: Really, Canada was against the war and with France.
<Pickle> The biggest rodeo in the world is the Calgary Stampede.
<Pickle> MrRod, no, it's marked "Alberta beef".
<Pickle> Fuck a Canada.
<Mikey^> since Dec.2000 the national anthem of USSR is back in Russia, it's sang every morning. Duma voted 51 v. 381 to have it back
<Mikey^> hehe
<hashbar> damn rodeo
<Fazze> The russian anthem is awesome. but they changed the lyrics
<the-anti> And it's a lot cheaper to build wind farms on land than in the ocean, of course.  Once hydrogen fuel cells are perfected it will be the best course of action.
<MrRod> Pickle:  That's like California cheese.
<NicDanger> Fazze, they had to change 'em
<MrRod> Pickle:  Or California eggs.
<Solon> the-anti but i guess we have to start somewhere...so i'm for that in any place that it's applicable
<Pickle> MrRod, more like California wine, actually. 
<Mikey^> the red flag is still there, but it's present in the red army only
<MrRod> Pickle:  Are there times when cattle are herded through the streets of Calgary, kind of like what they do in Denver?
<the-anti> I know it seems regressive to go from nuclear fission to windmills...
<Pickle> MrRod, beats me.  I live in Edmonton.  I don't know what those cattlefuckers do.
<hashbar> all the beef here is "canadian" you can get alberta beef if you wanna pay extra like an idiot
<Pickle> Ask Swigert, he is one :)
<MrRod> Pickle:  Actually, California cheese and California eggs are pushed a lot harder than California wine.
<Fazze> hmm.. you need 1000 windmills to replace one 1000MW nuclear reactor. that kinda sucks ya know
<MrRod> Pickle:  Swigert is a cattlefucker?
<Pickle> MrRod, but its wine is more famous.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Imagine that.
<Pickle> MrRod, he lives in Calgary. 
<the-anti> Fazze, nah, only about 3-400
<Dirk_IIV> autoavunculaargraatios
<hashbar> thats not even bad
<Dirk_IIV> something like that
<NicDanger> Fazze, but windmills can't melt down.
<the-anti> At $1 million each.  How much does a 1 Gigwatt nuclear plant cost to build?
<Fazze> but they can stop
<zzyzx> the-anti: I am pro-safe nuclear.  But, all this green power will go downhill with a 1 billion US population in 100 years.
<Pickle> Calgarians call Edmontonians commie pricks, and Edmontonians call Calgarians cowfuckers.  It's just our way.
<NicDanger> Fazze, wind doesn't stop very often on the high plains.
<bratton> Pickle:  i'd hate to ask what they call Americans
<Mikey^> btw I can see anti-semitism in Putin, his party Unity created one for youth it's called Walking Together, their leaders are neo-nazis, their main goal is to disrupt anti-globalisation protesters.
<MrRod> Pickle:  I would have expected the strange people to live north, not south.
<zzyzx> The high plains is not useless land, the useless land is the privately owned land of so. cal.
<the-anti> In 100 years hydrogen fusion will be a viable energy source and by then we could be producing thousands of Gigawatts through wind and possibly solar/geothermal or maybe even harnessing lightning.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Do you get to see the Northern Lights a lot?
<NicDanger> Read about Minnesota ranchers putting windmills on their land and they love it.  The cattle don't even notice and the windmills provide great extra income.
<Pickle> MrRod, not so much in the city
<MrRod> the-anti:  Energy production based on Karma.  Think about it.
<Pickle> But not infrequently
<Pickle> Not nearly as much as when I lived up north, though.  :)
<the-anti> I don't like to think about karma :)
<NicDanger> Pickle, say, how far is it from Edmonton to NWT?  I'm planning on driving it in August.
<zzyzx> the-anti : for cars hydrogen I don't think is the right way to go, lithium-ion or lithium-polymer is it. 1000 miles or more on a cubic yard of batteries.  Lithium is also cheap.
<the-anti> Yeah lithium is almost as abundant as dirt
<Pickle> NicDanger, well, when I lived in Yellowknife, there were people who claimed they could make the trip to Edmonton in one day.  I shudder to think about how fast they were going, if true, though.
<MrRod> Edmonton looks so isolated on the map.  It's almost like living in Alaska.  I couldn't take it.
<Solon> the-anti energy consumption is directly realted to the energy sources availability
<NicDanger> Pickle, got a brother in Hay River, going for a visit.
<Pickle> NicDanger, if you drive anywhere sanely it's a day's drive at least to the border.
<NicDanger> Pickle, yeah, I figured that, was just hoping to hear something more optimistic
<Pickle> NicDanger, you could make it in a day to Hay River if you push it.  But I wouldn't.  I'd stop in either Peace River or High Level.
<NicDanger> Of course, if we bring in all this alternate energy, what excuse will Bush have for invading oil countries?
--- Starting response with 'countries'
--- Responding: 'countries of compassion that it will the constant alarm '
<dubbya> countries of compassion that it will the constant alarm 
<zzyzx> MrRod and everybody: Boycott California produce and milk, it is all produced by illegal immigrant labor.
<panini> Pickle I've been to those places!
<Pickle> panini, cool :)
<panini> i made it to hay river in a day...
<panini> past it
<Solon> NicDanger if wind was the primary energy source then bus was accused for invading other states for their winds...
<Pickle> panini, it's certainly doable.
<the-anti> 100,000 windmills could produce up to 3 Tera Watts of power (almost enough to power the entire US) and would cost less than one month of this war
<MrRod> zzyzx:  What's it to you?  You have something against hard-working Mexicans?
<zzyzx> MrRod: Whats wrong with harder working Americans.
<MrRod> Pickle:  No worries about the mounties chasing you down?  Cars go a lot faster than their horses, I'm sure!
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Because they're doing jobs 'harder working' Americans won't do.  It's beneath them.
<panini> Pickle I took greyhound
<NicDanger> Solon, and if his backers could make money on that, he would invade them.
<^rcane> the-anti: wow, that cheap?
<^rcane> the-anti: now you said up to
<panini> zzyzx is racist
<^rcane> the-anti: so it can produce less
<the-anti> Assuming $700,000 per windmill, that's $70 billion
<bratton> zzyzx:  California is already a white-minority state... i'm not sure if we can back away from cheap labor
<Pickle> We never made it any further than High Level
<Solon> the-anti 100,000 windmills hummm aqnd where exactly you plan to put those? Mexico?
<zzyzx> MrRod: It is not beneath them, Repo farmers like to pay $3 hour.
<Pickle> MrRod, the Mounties use photo radar now :)
<the-anti> rcane, yes there isn't always 20 mph winds everywhere
<Mikey^> the Mounties love to Mount on something
<panini> Pickle i went all the to the end of the road...
<panini> Yellowknife!
<the-anti> Solon, "fly-over country"
<Pickle> panini, actually the end of the road is a ways up the ingraham trail
<Pickle> Couple hundred miles iirc
<MrRod> panini:  More of a zenophobe.
<zzyzx> panini: is a racist.
<panini> yes i know, most liberals are racist
<panini> they want to keep minorities suppressed
<Solon> xenophob
<Pickle> panini, did you fly up to Inuvik?
<zzyzx> bratton: You can back away from anything.  The the farmer spend long jail time in prison for hiring imigrants 5-10 life.
<panini> pickle no didn't get a chance
<Pickle> panini, pity.  Nice place.
<Pickle> I lived there for a couple of years.
<^rcane> repo farmers?
<Shoot2Kil> the british troops think it may take months to get the rebels out of Basra
<MrRod> Pickle:  What do people do for a living there?
<bratton> zzyzx:  i greatly doubt that'll happen
<Pickle> MrRod, they work for the government, they work for the tourism or transportation industry, or they're natives.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Which are you?
<Pickle> MrRod, I was government.  Well, my mom was.
<MrRod> Pickle:  Sounds like they have no real economy.
<Shoot2Kil> there is lumber and mining here and there used to be fishing too
<Pickle> MrRod, not really.  Inuvik is a remnant from the DEW line.  It's a government-created town to replace Aklavik.
<Solon> The mutilated body of a 64-year-old nun was discovered yesterday in a sleeping bag in a Virginia Beach parking lot...nothing is sacred anymore...sigh...
<zzyzx> bratton: that is because money makes right.
<Pickle> MrRod, but it was an important northern administration centre for the territories.
<zzyzx> panini: move to mexico, the governemt will give you no services, and expect you to pay a years fee to live there.
<Solon> BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan - A fire engulfed a crowded passenger bus in Kyrgyzstan on
<Solon> Thursday, killing 40 people on board
<Pickle> It's also the very end of the road.  Only way to drive further north is over the ice road in the winter only.  So it's got a significant tourism industry.  Also hunting, trapping, native art, and whatnot.
<the-anti> Oh, one other thing before I go to sleep... A single terrorist attack could take out a nuclear power plant and cause $billions in economic losses as well as massive death or cancer.  It's a lot harder to take out hundreds of windmills spread out over miles.
--- Starting response with 'miles'
--- Responding: 'miles far away their mom sucks dick for this really don't let me '
<dubbya> miles far away their mom sucks dick for this really don't let me 
<Pickle> LOTS of hippies fled up there in the 70s and 80s as well.
<panini> zzyzx I've been to mexico many times, I love it there
<panini> i might well live there some day
<zzyzx> panini: la ti da for your team.
<Pickle> I wouldn't mind going back if they paid me enough.
<panini> thanks
<MrRod> panini:  The corruption in Mexico is kind of a downer, though.
<panini> rod yeah but it can also work in your favor if you know how to game the system
<zzyzx> There is no corruption the officals were elected in a fair election.
<Pickle> Yeah, people I've talked to who lived in Mexico say it's a bribe-based economy
<MrRod> Pickle:  I'd live in a tent on Guam for a year if I was paid enough.
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Just like in Cuba, right?  ;)
<Pickle> MrRod, there are places in the territories I'd never return to.
<MrRod> Mexico also has a higher murder rate than the US.
<panini> saddam was also elected in a fair election
<^rcane> panini: true dat
<MrRod> Pickle:  You'd die of bordom?
<Pickle> Fort Smith springs to mind.
<panini> rod true but most of those are drug murders
<MrRod> panini:  Would you drive through Mexico City at night?
<Pickle> MrRod, I don't mind quiet towns, if they aren't dingy ratholes with a high asshole population.
<^rcane> I drove through dc at night
<^rcane> mexico city cant be worse
<panini> rod i wouldn't drive in mexico, period
<Daedalus2> Good lord, some of these reporters....
<MrRod> ^rcane:  It is worse.
<zzyzx> MrRod: Cuba was a uprising by the people, they didn't want to be governed by Kings anymore (Dezi Arnez).  There is a great movie picture Havana Robert Redford.
<^rcane> panini would take the cab
<^rcane> MrRod: no way..
<panini> ore da bus :)
<panini> -e
<MrRod> ^rcane:  Not if he had any sense.  Cabs in Mexico City aren't safe.
<^rcane> MrRod: I know :)
<panini> rod i know about the cabs there, but i took em anywy
<^rcane> see...
<panini> but i was was prepared
<MrRod> panini:  You brought your wits and good humor?
<panini> i knew what to do if he tried to rob me
<the-anti> and a condomn
<MrRod> panini:  What?
<Pickle> MrRod, if I'm very, very lucky I might somehow realize my dream of living in Victoria, BC.  Which has nothing going for it except it's quiet with a lovely client and few pricks.
<^rcane> bend over
<Pickle> client=climate.  Bah.
<panini> i knew their methods
<MrRod> Pickle:  Then why not get in the car and move?
<Shoot2Kil> Victoria= half deads and newlyweds
<panini> namely, they drive you to a dark alley and pretend that the car stalled
<MrRod> panini:  So you jump out and run?
<panini> then, his accomplice jumps out of the bushes and opens the cab door and robs you
<Pickle> MrRod, nothing to do there outside of government, and a high cost of living.
<^rcane> how do you pretend a car is stalled?
<Shoot2Kil> and the whole island is sinking
<MrRod> ^rcane:  With a Mexican cab it's easy.  ;)
<panini> even if you locked the door, the lock doesn't work and can be opened from the outside
<^rcane> oh yea... a lowrider
<Daedalus2> wow, a full screen without the "I" word
<the-anti> "Oh no senor, the car has stalled!"  "Try turning the key the opposite direction from the way you just turned it"
<^rcane> panini: and what do you do when he comes from the bushes
--- Starting response with 'bushes'
--- Responding: 'bushes and third person singular present participle been, present subjunctive be against this is not in real life '
<dubbya> bushes and third person singular present participle been, present subjunctive be against this is not in real life 
<the-anti> scream like a woman
<panini> well you don't wait till then... you have to act before then
<panini> by then it would be too late
<^rcane> what do you do when he pretends the car is stalled/
<panini> you yell at him at in a VERY LOUD VOICE to keep driving...
<the-anti> As soon as he enters the dark ally you slit his throat, then reach under the seat and grab his gun, then shoot the guy as he jumps out of the bushes
<^rcane> but if he is in an ally...
<panini> and if he doesn't, you start beating him
<panini> until he does
<MrRod> panini:  But what if the cab really is stalling?
<panini> and you step on the gas pedal yourself if you have to
<^rcane> your joking panini
<panini> actually the checklist starts when you get in the cab
<zzyzx> panini: I have nothing against mexicans, however I just am sick of this lacksadazical immigration policy the benefits only the employer and the consumer (only short-term 2-years).
<panini> first, only pick a cab driver that you feel you could personally beat the shit out of if things got ugly
<MrRod> panini:  Do you have a checklist for Tijuana brothels?
<bratton> save yourself the trouble and don't go to Mexico
<panini> rod sure :)
<^rcane> woohoo!
<^rcane> break out the tequilla
<Shoot2Kil> taxi
<Shoot2Kil> oops
<panini> then you have to double check the lock thing... make sure the door can't be opened from the outside
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Who doesn't benefit?
<Shoot2Kil> taxi's in south africa are very dangerous
<panini> zzyzx benefits only the employer and the consumer?? that's everyone!
<bratton> panini:  is that like a "child-proof" lock on some sedans?
<^rcane> not as dangerous as taxis in judea or samaria
<zzyzx> MrRod: No one benefits except the employer to make his fortune.  Homes would be 100K here if it were not for population growth and immigration.
<panini> bratton its kind of the opposite of child proof
<Blackt> nooooo.. don't tell me you're all sick of talking about the WAR already!!
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Where?
<Pickle> Hah, this British air marshal is doing a Schwarzkopf-type interview.
<zzyzx> Los angeles
<Pickle> "Frankly, I'm offended that you would ask that question."
<^rcane> who would want to live in los angeles
<^rcane> another riot?
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Were you born there?
<^rcane> we just got here
<bratton> Blackt:  aren't you?
<Shoot2Kil> thugs put phoney taxi lights on the top of the car and hope someone with a little money will get in and there is no way out
<Blackt> bratton.. when it ends... I'll quit saying... END THIS STUPID WAR.
<zzyzx> MrRod: Yes, unfortunately, my idiot dad moved from Minnesota to design the Space Shuttle.
<MrRod> Shoot2Kil:  I'll bear that in mind next time I vacation in South Africa.
<^rcane> zzyzx: he designed the space shuttle? he might actually be an idiot
<Daedalus2> pickle: hey he shut down that al-jazeera weenie though
<^rcane> zzyzx: bring back the saturn v
<zzyzx> SSME - Space Shuttle Main Engines
<the-anti> In places like that, you just shoot the cab driver, no one will notice...
<Shoot2Kil> it's just a matter of time before it gets to that state in most places
<zzyzx> ^rcane: hes dead now though.
<panini> zzyzx well shut down the borders then... security would improve too
<Pickle> Daedalus2, yeah, he's really aggressive with the reporters, like Stormin' Norman.
<^rcane> zzyzx: sorry to hear
<bratton> the-anti:  instant rent-a-car
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Well, you know, you can move to a part of the country where houses are still $100K or less.  My sister moved the South Carolina and bought a house there for $80K.  The downside is that the economy isn't as good and you can't make as much money.  So it all evens out in the end.
<the-anti> yep :)
<Daedalus2> well, that and the al-jazeera comment was really outta place.
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Did he work for Rockwell in Anaheim?
<^rcane> MrRod: a house or a shack?
<Daedalus2> posed as if he were going to ask a question, and turns around and delivers his commentary
<the-anti> Until the next guy who took my advice sees you at an intersection :)
<MrRod> ^rcane:  No, a house.  On a big lot.  She owns her lot and the lot next door, which is empty.
<zzyzx> Rockwell in Anaheim to start then Rockwell (Rockedyne) in Canoga Park.
<^rcane> MrRod: nice
<panini> what was the aljizeera comment?
<bratton> the-anti:  those blood stains on the upholstery would be a bitch
<MrRod> ^rcane;  It's a pretty nice house.
<Daedalus2> well, he mentioned that al-jazeera carrying the photos of the uk KIAs was in poor taste, and that it was a violation of the GCs for Iraq...
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq has made by a region of where sensitive materials around '
<dubbya> iraq has made by a region of where sensitive materials around 
<^rcane> kias?
<^rcane> they werent kias
<^rcane> they were kpows
<Daedalus2> and the al jazeera guy stands up like he's going to ask a question and says "we don't work for the coalition, we don't work for iraq, we are delivering news"
--- Starting response with 'news"'
--- Responding: 'if we don't tell the reach under an order at him service and all the beltway sniper... '
<dubbya> if we don't tell the reach under an order at him service and all the beltway sniper... 
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Are you having trouble getting along with the LA economy?
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Trying to buy a house but find it's too expensive?
<Daedalus2> they changed status? recently they were KIA
<^rcane> Daedalus2: can I get extra cheese with that?
<Pickle> He basically called the guy a shill for Iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq acquire fissile material, it should not seek peace requires it to defeat his country very scared little bitch us-male` i wonder if i don't mind next bold steps to be gone to keep them "fries" '
<dubbya> iraq acquire fissile material, it should not seek peace requires it to defeat his country very scared little bitch us-male` i wonder if i don't mind next bold steps to be gone to keep them "fries" 
<zzyzx> MrRod: I am not working, but the economy is not that bad. 
<Daedalus2> cheese?
<the-anti> I think if I found myself trying to catch a cab in South Africa the only place I'd be headed is the embassy to get me a plane ticket out of there.
<Blackt> huh? what'd I miss.. what al jazeera guy said what? where?
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Unemployed?
<^rcane> you are a delivery boy, right?
<panini> that's cool pickle
<Daedalus2> well, that's what al-jazeera has been...'liberation of iraq' is stated as 'occupation of iraq' 
--- Starting response with 'iraq''
--- Responding: 'iraq' is mobilizing against iraq '
<dubbya> iraq' is mobilizing against iraq 
<Daedalus2> rcane: uh, not quite.
<panini> these things need to be said
<^rcane> what liberation of iraq
<MrRod> Pickle:  Well someone has to play that role, I suppose.
<^rcane> iraqis do not want to be liberated
--- Starting response with 'liberated'
--- Responding: 'those who sings "good bye to be lifted '
<dubbya> those who sings "good bye to be lifted 
<panini> they probably want to, but do they deserve to?
<^rcane> if they did, they would revolt
<Shoot2Kil> then they can be martyrs
<Daedalus2> yeah they like living in squalor w/ no food while saddam invites the republican guard over for a pool party at the palace
<panini> i say no
<Blackt> ^rcane, my take on it is they do want to be liberated.. but they don't want some other country in their country liberating them...(if that makes any sense).
<MrRod> Pickle:  I have to say, though, I have a lot of respect for the Iraqi TV technicians.  They're amazing.  The US keeps trying to put Iraqi TV off the air but they're able to keep it running even through all those attacks.
--- Starting response with 'attacks'
--- Responding: 'attacks the citizen :) '
<dubbya> attacks the citizen :) 
<panini> just as the palestinians do not deserve to be liberated
<^rcane> daedalus, maybe so... but who are we to liberate them without them asking us to?
<zzyzx> MrRod: Unemployed for a year.  But it is kind-of choice, I am looking for something in computers.  Any work?
<IamKing> MrRod:  not after the 2nd attack today...they're still current off the air
<^rcane> panini: liberated from what? they have a country 
<MrRod> zzyzx:  Oh.
<IamKing> err, currently
<Daedalus2> well, some people will tell you they HAVE asked us too privately, one on one.. but wait a minute, when did YOU change sides?
<^rcane> I didn't change sides
<^rcane> I am just saying is this a war of liberation?
<^rcane> or a war of american interests
<Pickle> Both.
<Daedalus2> its a lot of things
<IamKing> rcane:  both
<^rcane> hey, we as americans have the right to keep our interests up
<Blackt> it's all about OIL.. and that's that... meanwhile some iraqi civilians are dying and our troops are getting shot to shit... bad war... boooooo..
--- Starting response with 'boooooo'
--- Responding: 'iraq invaded kuwait and possibly solar/geothermal or modified their backs to inform the plane ticket out the us-troops '
<dubbya> iraq invaded kuwait and possibly solar/geothermal or modified their backs to inform the plane ticket out the us-troops 
<MrRod> zzyzx:  That seems like a long time to be unemployed.  
<the-anti> It's a war of spring cleaning.
<IamKing> Blackt:  and you're a complete ignoramus
<Pickle> It's a war of American interests that happens to also be a war of liberation.  Which doesn't diminish from the fact that it is also the latter.
<Daedalus2> shot to shit. while i don't enjoy the idea of one of our guys dying, you make it sound like coalition forces are being massacred
<Blackt> IamKing... boing.. is that a counterpoint?
<zzyzx> MrRod: working.  Well I am living lean.  Top Ramen and 2 tacos and a water.
<Shoot2Kil> saddam is going so it's about more than oil
<MrRod> ^rcane:  It seems a bit silly for Bush to call it a 'war of liberation'.  It's kind of like something out of Orwell's 1984.
--- Starting response with '1984'
--- Responding: 'and security council unanimously passed away i know why do nothing to hold iraq continues to reform which must now we will probably have freedom to claim that region '
<dubbya> and security council unanimously passed away i know why do nothing to hold iraq continues to reform which must now we will probably have freedom to claim that region 
<IamKing> Blackt:  just a statement of fact, thus devaluing the bullshit propoganda you just spewed
<Mikey^> why they don't drop an atomic bomb? it would be over soon
--- Starting response with 'soon'
--- Responding: 'soon as lubricant for losses '
<dubbya> soon as lubricant for losses 
<Mikey^> gee
<Blackt> Shoot2Kil... Saddam won't give US oil.. so sure, he's going.. if the US can get him out.
<ScuZzy160> you are an idiot
<^rcane> saddam will either escape, die trying, or just die
<Daedalus2> hahah 'if the us can get him out' you make him sound like some kinda superman
<Blackt> everything is propaganda these days.. truth or no
<Mikey^> Rumsfeld once met Saddam when he was in the Reagan's administration 
<IamKing> Blackt:  wrong, yet again...we still bought oil from Iraq even during sanctions...it was oil for food
--- Starting response with 'food'
--- Responding: 'food on the country by the threat comes from each producing chemical and a ruptured appendix complications apparently giving details yet '
<dubbya> food on the country by the threat comes from each producing chemical and a ruptured appendix complications apparently giving details yet 
<^rcane> Daedalus2: we will drop kryptonite
<Mikey^> back then Saddam was a "nice" guy, they thought
<ScuZzy160> you don't know anything about the sanctions, the ceasefire, or the oil for food programme, do you ?
<the-anti> Mikey, because there are plenty of countries with itchy fingers on their own button waiting for us to do that.  And while the PAC-3's are pretty good, they're not perfect, and most or all of them are sitting on the other side of the world right now.
<Mikey^> or because they didn't cared
<Daedalus2> there's an idea
<Shoot2Kil> he has enemies around him
<ScuZzy160> you only know valueless rhetoric, isn't that right ?
<MrRod> I wonder if the Iranian clerics are shitting gold bricks these days.
<Shoot2Kil> he has tortured too many people
<Daedalus2> gold?
<Blackt> When you can show me.. there aren't tons of contracts going to TX oil cronies... I'll believe it's not about OIL.. and contracts and money.
<Karellen^> PAC-3s are useless against ICBMs, right?
<Daedalus2> damn, i'm goin' to Iran and pick up some dung then
<Pickle> A voluntary human shield who went to Iraq in January claims that no one would believe that he hadn't been paid by Saddam to go there.  Everyone hated Saddam, and all his "supporters" had either been paid for or thretened into mugging for the cameras.
--- Starting response with 'cameras'
--- Responding: 'cameras despite that is reliant upon us, and the guy or makes the riskiest of international atomic bomb? tactical fire engulfed a democratic palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the threat gathering to our nation against the war is stalled? '
<dubbya> cameras despite that is reliant upon us, and the guy or makes the riskiest of international atomic bomb? tactical fire engulfed a democratic palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the threat gathering to our nation against the war is stalled? 
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: who cares who oil contracts are or are not going to..? its pure sophistry to try to make a connection
<Pickle> He went back thinking what an idiot he was for thinking anyone in Iraq genuinely wanted Hussein.
--- Starting response with 'hussein'
--- Responding: 'hussein is where is well they spend long loiter time for iraq. '
<dubbya> hussein is where is well they spend long loiter time for iraq. 
<IamKing> Blackt:  what you blame the US for as our supposed reason for going in is the same thing that France, Germany, and Russia are guilty of
<zzyzx> How many in America, hopes we go in and take the oil and sells it for $10 a barrel, cause gas to drop to $0.50 a gallon? 
<Daedalus2> pickle: the taxi driver?
<Daedalus2> more people should read that one
<Mikey^> Shoot it's reported Saddam killed more than 30,000 Kurds, erased villages, used chemical against them, etc.
<Pickle> Daedalus, yeah.
<Karellen^> If gas drops to 50, you will be only paying the tax
<^rcane> zzyzx: $10 a barrel is $0.90 a gallon
<MrRod> Pickle:  Well, live and learn.
<IamKing> Blackt:  they all stand to lose on this since they chose to not take a chance and be a part of the war...now they will have nothing
<Daedalus2> if gas drops to 50 cents, i don't care if i'm only paying tax
<Blackt> ScuZzy160... makeing connections is what this war is all about... It's sure not my war...it's the war of the president and his vice president.
<^rcane> when did the feds go and increase the gas tax again?
<Karellen^> My intended point was that gas is not ever gonna be 50 again :-/
<Shoot2Kil> i want a gas cut and an insurance cut
<Blackt> lol Karellen
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: it is your war, now go and fight for Saddam !
<IamKing> lol
<Shoot2Kil> and they are charging to much for these tin cans these days too
<markus33a> Scuzzy: Blackt is fighting for Saddam right now, a PR campaign for Saddam
<MrRod> Actually, gas prices have not gone up significantly over the past 30 years if you take into account inflation.
<Daedalus2> yeah, Iraqi insurgents on IRC
<Blackt> ScuZzy.. there ya go with those non-logic cross-lies.. Pro-Peace.. anti-war.. protestors.. such as myself are NOT Pro-Saddam
<markus33a> haha
<^rcane> from $1.10 to $1.60 in 2 years
<^rcane> that is a drastic amount
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: now why exactly are you against ths war ?
<MrRod> Blackt:  You still support Saddam.
<Blackt> lies lies and more lies.. it's a crappy war fro a crappy reason... OIL.. and it should end
<Daedalus2> right, that's why you go to those Pro-Saddam rallies, right?
<^rcane> Blackt: it is not just about oil
<zzyzx> Daedalus2: if the us. fed (no dummy oil companies) could take control and drop oil to $5 a barrel.
<^rcane> Blackt: it is about territory
<Pickle> Blackt, oh, it will.  After Hussein has been destroyed.
<^rcane> Blackt: influence
<^rcane> Blackt: power
<^rcane> Blackt: revenge
<Pickle> Which should be in under three months.
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: you know we went to war with Japan in WWII over oil, right ?
<the-anti> The oil is just a side benefit
<Daedalus2> if it were all about oil. ok. don't drive your car. don't turn on your lights. don't turn on your heater, don't cook your food, ....
<Blackt> oh ^rcane.. you mean it's about BUSH being vindictive and going after Saddam... because of his father?
--- Starting response with 'father'
--- Responding: 'father lived in confronting both '
<dubbya> father lived in confronting both 
<^rcane> and get off your computer
<MrRod> Pickle:  No, it won't end that soon.  The US still has to pay for the recovery of Iraq.
<^rcane> Blackt: some of it
<Blackt> still wrong..
<Pickle> That's the deadline the British air marshal claimed that they were aiming for to get oil exportation back online.
<^rcane> Blackt: You are wrong
<MrRod> Pickle:  Three months?  What about another 100 hour war?
<^rcane> Blackt: and a troll
<markus33a> Blackt: how how about the fact that Iraq is in violation of the cease fire agreement he signed in 1991?
--- Starting response with '1991'
--- Responding: '1991 to be quiet '
<dubbya> 1991 to be quiet 
<ScuZzy160> so why are you against the war Blackt ?
<^rcane> a bad troll at that
<markus33a> and has been for years
<Daedalus2> you know, people mock him for that. were someone to try and kill my dad, you're damn right i'd go after them. so even if it were for that i'd still say 'so?'
<Blackt> *sigh*
<markus33a> Blackt: are you in college right now?
<Daedalus2> Blackt: how's your dad?
<Pickle> MrRod, it went out with the "Scud Stud".
<ScuZzy160> its hard ramming drivel down the throats of informed people, isn't it, Blackt ?
<Pickle> Kosovo took about 6 months.
<ScuZzy160> I can see why you are frusterated
<IamKing> Blackt:  that's because you ARE a troll
<the-anti> Saddam died of cancer in 1999, and since then Osama has been running the country behind the scenes.  How'
<zzyzx> They want to get iraq done fast to avoid the heat.
--- Starting response with 'heat'
--- Responding: 'heat and all those resolutions of reckless gamble '
<dubbya> heat and all those resolutions of reckless gamble 
<the-anti> How's that for a conspiracy theory? :)
<Blackt> markus33a... I don't know about that...
<Mikey^> after Irak it's Chechnya, then North Korea, China, Canada, France etc.
<IamKing> anti:  lol
<Daedalus2> saddam is really one of Gerry Anderson's Marrionettes?
<Mikey^> :P
<ScuZzy160> let the Russians deal with Chechnya
<Mikey^> and finally Texas
<Shoot2Kil> Canada eh?
<ScuZzy160> I'm all for bumping France up ahead of schedule
<Shoot2Kil> where's my sling shot?
<Mikey^> lol
<Pickle> No way.  After how Russia stabbed America in the back Bush is going to hammer Russia over Chechnya.
--- Starting response with 'chechnya'
--- Responding: 'many have it had no link between blackmail a dead '
<dubbya> many have it had no link between blackmail a dead 
<Blackt> markus33a, no I graduated college back in 1988
<Daedalus2> it'd be easy for special ops to get into france. smell bad, and act pompous and they'll fit right in
<^rcane> how does blackt survive in montana?
<the-anti> France has the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world.
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: would that happen to be beauty college ?
<markus33a> Blackt: I just have a friend named T, and he always talks about being black....thought maybe you were him
<markus33a> and he hates republicans too
<markus33a> but I am one...so I guess he doesn't hate them all
<Mikey^> there's a big problem in Russia, they suffer from Chechnyaphobia, they don't respect rights of minorities so they'll never be able to be member of European Union 
<Daedalus2> you have a friend that hates republicans? shame.
<Blackt> ScuZzy160, no... math/cs/chemistry
<Pickle> After this is North Korea.  If America is smart it will just pull out and leave the problem up to the Chinese and South Koreans to solve.
<Blackt> ^rcane?... r u asking what I do for a living?
<Daedalus2> one of my friends one night talked about how much he hates republicans.... haven't talked to him in 2 years
<MrRod> Blackt:  Couldn't make up your mind?
<markus33a> Daedalus: haha
<^rcane> Blackt: no
<IamKing> Blackt reminds me of moron MCSEs that THINK they know what the fuck they're doing, but really don't   ;)
<MrRod> Yes.  What DO you DO?
<^rcane> Blackt: I asked how you survive in montana
<Blackt> MrRod.. I couldn't get enough academia.. wanted to learn everything;)
<Mikey^> Russia block access of other baltic countries to European Union, they refuse to ratify the territory treaty
<^rcane> MrRod: he teaches at the local co-op
<Daedalus2> you still don't understand the question.
<MrRod> Blackt:  Yes, aren't we all?  ;)
<Solon> Blackt like Gore
<Blackt> ;)
<Daedalus2> what he's asking is..with your political viewpoints and comments, why the hell are you not dead in montana
<^rcane> Mikey^: how can they block it?
<^rcane> what daedalus2 said
<Daedalus2> figured it needed to be rephrased to be understood
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: aren't you concerned about civilian casualties in Iraq ?
--- Starting response with ''
--- Responding: 'this war from hm ? '
<dubbya> this war from hm ? 
<^rcane> Daedalus2: how hard is it to understand it?
<Blackt> I guess I'm just too tough a cookie to die.. Daedalus2
<Daedalus2> I don't know, I understood it
<^rcane> Daedalus2: I think he is one of those chapter h foreign imports
<Daedalus2> hahah
<Shoot2Kil> civilians can leave baghdad
<markus33a> Shoot2Kil: not really
<Shoot2Kil> did you see all the trafic riding alongside the 3-7?
<Blackt> ScuZzy160, I'm concerned about all casualites on both sides.. death is a pretty final...
<markus33a> Shoot2Kil: The Iraqi military is threatening to kill people who try to leave Iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq regime defies us '
<dubbya> iraq regime defies us 
<Daedalus2> that's nothing though. try being a conservative in Hollywood.
<Daedalus2> and I'M still alive
<MrRod> ^rcane;  Chapter H?
<ScuZzy160> I'm very concerned about civilian casualties in Iraq too.. that is why I support removing Saddam by force
<Shoot2Kil> they can go to see cousings in Basra
<Shoot2Kil> oops
<Mikey^> rcane places like Lettonia, Estonia are former satellites countries from USSR.. yet Russia still have power over them, they refuse to ratify the treaty about the delimitation of their territory, why? because Moscow want to make sure these places treat well the russian minority who live in Kaliningrad (they're treated like illegal immigrant by Lettonia authority)
<Blackt> Somebody earlier said ... isn't it better to have the civilians over there die from US troops than at the hands of Saddam?... for christs sake.. what kind of logic is that???
<ScuZzy160> after almost 2 million people dead at Saddam's hand, I think its time he goes
<Shoot2Kil> if they still call Basra a place in iraq that is
--- Starting response with 'is'
--- Responding: 'is still crooked botox brow... that came out firework show? carpet bomb? it is, involving thousands of walking '
<dubbya> is still crooked botox brow... that came out firework show? carpet bomb? it is, involving thousands of walking 
<Daedalus2> at least they'd die free...or in the process of gaining freedom
<Daedalus2> (Jaffa, CREE)
<Shoot2Kil> or umm qasr
<markus33a> Blackt: poor logic, not very well stated....but civilians over there are dying everyday under Saddams regime...that will be much less a problem when we remove the regime
<Blackt> damn.. that number just keeps getting bigger and bigger like a fish story.. Where the hell are you getting 2 million people? Scuzz?
<Politiks> Live Free or Die!
<Shoot2Kil> they just need to get on a bus
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: so you're ok with civilian casualties, but only if its Saddam that's killing them ?
<Mikey^> rcane really Russia is about to explode, it won't last long.. the skinheads run the place and the governors from the 89 districts want to revolt against Moscow anytime.. Putin himself said July 25 2002 that his country is about to be destroyed
<Blackt> ScuZzy.. hardly.. I'm not OK with any of it.
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: I said "almost" 2 million
<ScuZzy160> I believe it is more than 1.5 million
<ScuZzy160> known
<Blackt> yah well where do you get that figure from?
<IamKing> Blackt:  so just sit on your stupid ass and do nothing about it like the French, Germans, and Russians
<ScuZzy160> and its hard to have an exact figure you know
<Blackt> IamKing, my ass isn't stupid.. hose your head.
<Daedalus2> IamKing: yeah, stop eating at mcdonalds, don't buy coke, etc.
<Daedalus2> err blackt:
<Shoot2Kil> ScuZsy: where you that concerned when it was Kuwaits turn?
<Daedalus2> it's late
<the-anti> I've heard the 2 million figure a number of times
<MrRod> Holy Mother of Jesus!
<ScuZzy160> kuwait's turn ?
<Daedalus2> his ass isn't stupid. that's the SMART end
<ScuZzy160> what do you mean ?
<markus33a> I've heard a lot of figures that are more than 2 million
<IamKing> Blackt:  your ass is stupid because that's the only body part spewing shit out that it knows nothing about
<Blackt> the-anti... is that like the saying: If it's said enough times its true?
<Shoot2Kil> when Kuwait was under attack
<Mikey^> nite all
<Vinner_7> 2 million?  that is almost 10% of the population.  
<MrRod> markus33a:  2 million what?
<ScuZzy160> Shoot2Kil: what is your question ?
<Blackt> Dude, how much oil does Kuwait produce a day?... oh and how about Iraq?..
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq "loving" them with one day evaluation. then the united states supports political correctness is not very concerned. '
<dubbya> iraq "loving" them with one day evaluation. then the united states supports political correctness is not very concerned. 
<IamKing> Blackt:  yeah, if you keep telling yourself that this war is only about oil, you will eventually believe it without any facts to back it up
<Shoot2Kil> Kuwait is happy they were liberated
<ScuZzy160> you are assuming I am for removing Saddam now, but was against the Gulf War ?
<Blackt> IamKing.. there's plenty of facts about the OIL... contracts
<Daedalus2> kuwait produces more oil now, that we got iraq out of there, that's for sure
--- Starting response with 'sure'
--- Responding: 'sure there's a chemical and expect them to purchase highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for the ground, where our health care, and that is 'is' '
<dubbya> sure there's a chemical and expect them to purchase highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for the ground, where our health care, and that is 'is' 
<markus33a> MrRod: overall murders by Saddams regime in the 30 years he has been in power
<the-anti> Both the war and the opposition are about oil, to at least a degree.
<markus33a> 200,000 of his own people
<Daedalus2> blackt: yeah, that's why france and germany don't want to do anything. they're worried about their OIL contracts.
<IamKing> Blackt:  the only REAL contracts are the ones that French, German, and Russian companies have with them currently...which all 3 stand to lose a lot from this war
<Blackt> duh.. Daedalus2.. I agree with that
<ScuZzy160> IamKing: yep.. they have WMD for Oil programmes
<IamKing> WMD materials at the very least
<IamKing> along with other contraband
<MrRod> markus33a:  For a second I thought you were talking about the number of Iraqis who 'starved due to sanctions' while Saddam was spending tons of money building palaces rather than buying food.
--- Starting response with 'food'

<Daedalus2> <- gonna have the germans build his bunkers in his new house
<markus33a> March 16, 1998: Saddam kills 5000 civilians
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: no, I think you are wrong
<Blackt> LOL
<markus33a> MrRod: no way, I'm not that stupid
<ScuZzy160> you aren't really a Big Picture person, are you Blackt ?
<Blackt> ScuZzy.. did you read theOnion?
<the-anti> The funny thing is that daisy cutters and moabs aren't weapons of mass destruction.
<ScuZzy160> the Onion isn't a real paper
<Daedalus2> Blackt would have rather waited until saddam got nuke capability, gave it to terrorists to come over here and drop them on Montana.

<dubbya> i'd be governor, or maybe with time to tx oil now, with the a-10 though 
<markus33a> 1998=1988
<markus33a> is what i meant to type
<Daedalus2> "oops...told ya so"
<IamKing> Blackt:  is that where you get your "facts" from?
<ScuZzy160> is that where you get your news from ?
<Blackt> ScuZzy.. no I'm one who cant see the forest because of the trees...I admit that.
<ScuZzy160> no wonder you are such an idiot
<Daedalus2> oh dear God, the Onion?????
<Karellen^> The Onion is satire - 
<Daedalus2> that's like reading Mad Magazine for political commentary
<Daedalus2> in fact, Mad Magazine is BETTER
<Blackt> ScuZzy, no but your counterpoint was pretty much along the lines of the joke on the onion
<ScuZzy160> what counterpoint ?
<Blackt> "you're wrong"....whooh00... how about that for an argument...lol
<Daedalus2> count, and pointer-count
<markus33a> I know one thing for sure, I saw the pictures during the gulf war of kids with Saddam Hussein, where saddam was trying to be a good PR guy, and those kids looked FREAKED out....while the Iraqi kids are laughing and shaking hands with our soldiers
--- Starting response with 'soldiers'

<Daedalus2> if we didn't care about civilians there, we could have squashed the whole country already.
<Blackt> mp
<Blackt> oops
<ScuZzy160> markus: that is not true ! Saddam cares very much about civilian casualties !
<markus33a> Daedalus: we would've carpet bombed Baghdad the first night
--- Starting response with 'night'
--- Responding: 'night talked for it was one '
<dubbya> night talked for it was one 
<ScuZzy160> why else do you think he is trying to create so many ?
<Blackt> no... markus.. I'm not.. 
<Daedalus2> scuzzy: yeah he wants more
<Blackt> afk... 
<Karellen^> Heh that Onion piece is funny
<Daedalus2> absolutely f--ucking knowledgeless
<ScuZzy160> massive casualties is the only way Saddam can win
<IamKing> Blackt:  the only morons that I've heard on debates are people like the anti-war protestors...they have not one iota of a functioning brain cell to process any factual data nor run any logic over such data
<markus33a> "war is like bad and like not like the answer
<markus33a> "
<Daedalus2> call 'em what they are IamKing - Pro Saddam supporters
<IamKing> well, that they are
<Daedalus2> you're not getting an argument out of me.
<Daedalus2> i'm saying, don't be so politically correct :)
<ScuZzy160> the Iraqi people think war is the only answer
--- Starting response with 'answer'
--- Responding: 'answer your "facts" from? '
<dubbya> answer your "facts" from? 
<markus33a> why are there several human shields that came back from Iraq and completely changed their viewpoint on the whole situation?
<Shoot2Kil> if there are too many casualties he'll surrender because there won't be any slaves left
<Daedalus2> yeah, no one for his goa'uld offspring to take over
<ScuZzy160> Iraqis are scared to death that we aren't going to finish the job
--- Starting response with 'job'
--- Responding: 'job as a taste of some knock-out gas bagdad? '
<dubbya> job as a taste of some knock-out gas bagdad? 
<IamKing> I'm glad I'm not attending those protests to protest against the mainstream dumbass protesters...my tolerance for stupidity and ignorance is very low these days, and I'd probably go on a shooting spree killing off the weaker part of the human gene pool   ;)
<Daedalus2> that's it! Saddam is really a Goa'uld
<Solon> markus33a what's wrong with saying war is bad logically
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  We could let the Turks and Iranians take over from us.
<ScuZzy160> they're afraid the peace protesters and the UN will stop the US short of removing Saddam
<Blackt> IamKing.. if all you have to support your views is saying that your opposition is stupid.. who is the stupid one?
<MrRod> Blackt:  I guess that would be... you?
<markus33a> Solon: it shows a lack of knowledge in history and mankind overall
<markus33a> of course "war is bad"
<Solon> markus33a how so?
<markus33a> a lot smarter thing to say would be "i wish there could be no war, but I know that it is sometimes necessary."
<Daedalus2> hey was at a support rally up here, and some moron..wouldn't make it in L.A. - he stops at the stopsign and says "GEORGE BUSH SUCKS AND SO DOES YOUR WAR!" - and got mobbed...now, the proper thing to do is at least wait for the light to change to say that, not say it AS you're stopping 
--- Starting response with 'stopping'
--- Responding: 'and increased coast are frusterated '
<dubbya> and increased coast are frusterated 
<Blackt> nah...beeeeeeeeeep.. wrong MrRod
<IamKing> Blackt:  it's a statement of the obvious...not a statement of supporting proof to that...I would have hoped you had 1 brain cell active enough to differentiate between a thesis statement and supporting details
<ScuZzy160> Blackt: but when the opposition is clearly stupid to all who observe them, what else can be said about them ?
<IamKing> Blackt:  on the contrary...MrRod has guessed correctly
<Daedalus2> the opposition IS stupid. half the protestors are carrying signs saying "Keep Abortion Legal" "Free Nelson Mandella" - do they even know why they're there, or what year it is?
<IamKing> at least SCSI recognizes that it's not worth the effort of debating simple facts with fools such as yourself Blackt when you're quite obviously never going to be open to the truth
<Blackt> The war was started for personal gain of high ranking officials of this country.. not for any benefit of the american people. 
<IamKing> lol
<markus33a> The protestors hold signs that say "No war for oil" but if you go up to them and challenge them in debate, they have no idea what to say....they're walking "talking points"
<Daedalus2> "Make Snow cones and Candy, not War" yeah that was a brilliant protestor sign..like a snow cone is gonna solve the problem.
<markus33a> Blackt: that's just propoganda...show some facts
<ScuZzy160> IamKing: that wasn't a guess - he has a lot of supportive evidence to back it up
<IamKing> SCSI:  lmao...true   ;)
<GREATGUY> has anyone here seen the movie 1 hour photo and can explain the ending to me in /msg
<IamKing> self-evident evidence
<Shoot2Kil> terrorism has struck home 
--- Starting response with 'home'
--- Responding: 'home and british troops '
<dubbya> home and british troops 
<Blackt> the facts are pretty evident with Halliburton and Brown & Root
<Daedalus2> aren't you supposed to be playing trivia Greatguy?
<ScuZzy160> oh no \/ Blackt has envoked the name Halliburton !!!
<markus33a> Saddam Hussein has paid terrorists, Saddam Hussein hates America, Saddam Hussein is trying to develop nuclear weapons, Saddam Hussein probably has chemical and biological weapons...anyone else not see the threat?
--- Starting response with 'threat'
--- Responding: 'threat to help them french toast '
<dubbya> threat to help them french toast 
<ScuZzy160> **alarm bells sounding**
<Shoot2Kil> would bin laden be what he was if saddam had been killed the first time?
<Blackt> ya know what Brown & Root means in Australia?... LOL..uhm.. I should go... work to do...c-yas *wave*
<Shoot2Kil> no one ever said a war on terrorism would be easy
--- Starting response with 'easy'
--- Responding: 'easy for a day '
<dubbya> easy for a day 
<markus33a> Shoot: not a single person
<ScuZzy160> markus: its not a "probably".. people who might not have chemical weapons don't have Atropine and chemical protection suits, and they don't give orders to troops to use them
<ScuZzy160> yay!
<markus33a> Anyone that can't make the connection between the war on terrorism and taking it to Iraq, well....they're obviously never learned "connect the dots"
--- Starting response with 'dots"'
--- Responding: 'we should be funny that mandates a sock '
<dubbya> we should be funny that mandates a sock 
<markus33a> Scuzzy: i was just saying "probably" to avoid expanding the argument
<mr_wwil> they are going to kill us with wheat smut :/
<markus33a> to keep the argument simple
<bratpit> markus: there are a lot of dots to connect. And, it depends on how you connect them...
<markus33a> bratpit: is there a dot that says "saddam hates america"
<ScuZzy160> markus: yes, I see.. but still there is no need to back down on being assertive
<markus33a> true
<markus33a> bratpit: is there a dot that says saddam has paid the families of suicide bombers?
--- Starting response with 'bombers'

<dubbya> bombers and tired of california, geographically with people ? 
<bratpit> markus: oh, yes. You bet. And all the Iraquis do. Unfortunately

<dubbya> unfortunately the streets of them =] 
<ScuZzy160> I'm all for this war if for no other reason than punishing France
<markus33a> bratpit: how the hell do you know that?
<markus33a> because you see it on Iraqi tv?
<IamKing> SCSI:  lol
<markus33a> bratpit: the Iraqi people that are dancing in the streets and shaking hands with our troops, the ones in Basrah that are revolting against Saddams forces,  they don't seem to hate us that much
--- Starting response with 'much'
--- Responding: 'much damage as soon as yourself to bring destruction '
<dubbya> much damage as soon as yourself to bring destruction 
<bratpit> markus: So called coalition forces bobm their homeland. How could they love them?
<markus33a> the Iraqi people have been force-fed all of their bullshit information
<ScuZzy160> the problem with the people celebrating our troops is that they wind up dead the next day
<ScuZzy160> that's why the outburst have been fairly muted
<markus33a> scuzzy: i know, i think we'll know a lot more after the area is more secured
<Shoot2Kil> complete oppression
<IamKing> SCSI:  that's why those Iraqi civilians need to move south out of the combat area
--- Starting response with 'area'
--- Responding: 'area is dumb while inspectors were the world will confront both '
<dubbya> area is dumb while inspectors were the world will confront both 
<ScuZzy160> the Iraqi people need to realise that collectively, they can defeat Saddam
--- Starting response with 'saddam'
--- Responding: 'saddam hussein's orders, coalition forces to avert the "antiwar" movement agrees with the west of inspectors themselves '
<dubbya> saddam hussein's orders, coalition forces to avert the "antiwar" movement agrees with the west of inspectors themselves 
<markus33a> bratpit: what do you have to say about the civilian uprising?
<ScuZzy160> the problem is that GHWB told them to rise up and they did, and then he let them get slaughtered
<bratpit> The information here is also fltered hevily. I speak 4 languages and read the press from different sources. Facts are so different. I just try to find the truth for myself.
<ScuZzy160> and this time around they aren't so trusting of us
<markus33a> bratpit: live footage
<markus33a> bratpit: the arab media?
<ScuZzy160> not that they doubt our motives, but they doubt we are going to follow through
<markus33a> bratpit: the arab media is a joke
<Solon> markus33a if the population of basra is revolting how come british troops didnt enter basra in the past week?
<markus33a> scuzzy: true
<markus33a> scuzzy: that's why he have to see it all the way through...not seeing it through would be the worst possible thing we could do
<ScuZzy160> indeed
<markus33a> solon: because their our iraqi "troops" mixed in among the civilians
--- Starting response with 'civilians'
--- Responding: 'civilians can back it is a resolute people now support terrorists aboard weren't even a key the arab boob news without wtc! '
<dubbya> civilians can back it is a resolute people now support terrorists aboard weren't even a key the arab boob news without wtc! 
<Pickle> Solon, because the Hussein loyalists fired on them.
<bratpit> civilian uprising? Hate. They have so much hate there. It's very easy to abuse it and point them against anything.
<ScuZzy160> not following through would make us look weak and humiliated in the arab world
<Pickle> The rebellion was crushed.
<markus33a> bratpit: ??
<ScuZzy160> and THAT is what would lead to more terrorism
--- Starting response with 'terrorism'

<dubbya> terrorism to you get the process of congress to respond 
<ScuZzy160> I think Bush and Blair fully understand that

<ScuZzy160> and they won't back down now
<panini> no liberal understands that
<markus33a> MrRod: haha
<ScuZzy160> Blair is a liberal
<ScuZzy160> but he understands it
<panini> the arab world will respect only strength
<markus33a> Scuzzy: not when it comes to defense
<panini> not weakness
<markus33a> american liberals destroy our military
<ScuZzy160> so it seems :)
<panini> and we have to counteract a decade of weakness from clinton
<Shoot2Kil> tell chretien to live up to his word and get out now 
<ScuZzy160> the only thing that wasn't weak about Clinton was his libido
<panini> i meant american liberals
<IamKing> SCSI:  lol
<panini> it reminds of those neighborhood bullies where the townspeople are too scared to stand up to them
<IamKing> panini:  like that movie Friday   ;)
<MrRod> Pickle:  We need to you parachute from 30,000 feet into Baghdad with your laser pointer so you can help them identify targets and point your laser at them for the bombs.
<panini> they think it might make the bully mad, so they continue to live in fear
<IamKing> yeah...such an old story
<Solon> Pickle logically urban warfare is the worst and the most diffcult type of warfare especialy if it's in hostile urban terrirtory if the population seems to want you in there then they must advance the probabilty of incomming fire not from innocent civilians is higher making it easier to shoot back if the reports of rebelion are true
<IamKing> probably because it's unfortunately a part of human nature
<panini> that's what liberals are like
<IamKing> anything to keep the status quo so we don't risk losing anything
<panini> right
<IamKing> panini:  exactly why liberals are pansy assed  ;)
<Pickle> Solon, the allies have been supporting it by firing on loyalist positions.
<panini> if somebody hurts you, it must have been cause to did something to make them angry...
<Pickle> Solon, they've been holding back, hoping the rebels would do their work for them, largely.  
<markus33a> liberals are like the "90s man" from South park
<panini> so just be nicer to them and they won't hurt you....
<panini> that is the liberals thinking
<MrRod> panini:  Yes.  Hugs, not Bombs.

<panini> APPEASMENT

<dubbya> terrorists and 2006 be moved from baghdad with the united states for terrorism would make up in his kills them 
<Solon> Pickle they holded back even before the reports of rebelion...to say the brits are holding down their advanse due to a civilian rebelion is inaccurate
<panini> correct dirk
<Dirk_IIV> appeasement inviites terrorism
<IamKing> it's that kneepad philosophy
<panini> if we beat the living shit out of iraq, cleanly and quickly, all arabs will actually respect us... that's how they think
<markus33a> you see the Cover Story of the USA Today today?
<IamKing> they think if they suck the terrorists' dicks, they won't be bitchslapped before, during, or afterwards

<markus33a> or, I guess yesterday it would be now
<Pickle> Solon, it's part of the reason.  And a rebellion was expected in Basrah.  In 1991 it was a major base of Shi'a rebels.
<panini> no what does it say marcus
<ScuZzy160> one thing I wonder is - who do those "Peace is Patriotic" people think they are fooling ?
<Dirk_IIV> panini: that sounds like an extremist post, but it's right sir

<Shoot2Kil> have any of saddams daughters ever spoke out publicly?
<markus33a> MrRod: ouch
<Dirk_IIV> arabs don't understand anyone who isn't muslim
<Solon> Pickle the brits didnt entered basrah city because not entering cities is the chosen tactic so far in this war they preffered bypassing any possible barrier that can postpone movement into bagdad
<MrRod> panini:  Not nice but it does work.
<Dirk_IIV> unless they get their ass kicked
<ScuZzy160> MrRod: not just the black ones.. all of them
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  In the US blacks were generally the only slaves, though some people would argue otherwise.
<ScuZzy160> its the basic psychology of domination/submission
<Pickle> Solon, but they want Basra to get the ports operational for relief shipments.  They've had to settle for Umm Qasar, but they would prefer Basra.
<ScuZzy160> MrRod: but elsewhere in the world lots of different people were slaves
<markus33a> damn....i miss a lot being at work for 8 hours
<markus33a> +
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  True.  But not everyone made good slaves.  American Indians didn't make good slaves.

<MrRod> bradpit:  What do you do for a living?
<stove> Scuz/please, explain it more.
<IamKing> I'm working a low wage job that doesn't provide any benefits

<Daedalus2> centanni just said there were concussions
<stove> Scuz/what if it makes balance of power?
<ScuZzy160> for instance, when it comes to taking care of the finances, perhaps the husband in a marriage may be dominant, but when it comes to cooking dinner, the wife may be dominant
<IamKing> damn sirens in Kuwait City again
<bratpit> MrRod: Have you been to Bay Area?
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  Are you dominant?
<Solon> Pickle i personaly dont understand it but for me it seems taking the jordenian front as first objective was more logical 1)it is more closer to bagdad 2) you can use the airports to establish more secure supply lines and shorter 3)using more efficantly the air superiority of the US-UK air force
<ScuZzy160> stove: there is never true balance of power in anything
<MrRod> bratpit:  Yes, that's where I live.
<stove> Scuz/it may bring too much tension?
<Morningsi> Whenever I hear sirens or about sirens I think of Silent Hill 1 + 2.
<schifo> wtf did a missile hit kuwait ?
<schifo> steve centanni got all scared
<Daedalus2> not sure. centanni is kinda nervous
<ScuZzy160> MrRod: it depends on the person and the subject
<IamKing> schifo:  I doubt it...probably a Patriot killing off the Scuds
<Karellen^> Georgia lawmakers are on the ball
<Karellen^> Rep. John Noel, D-Atlanta, and four co-sponsors filed a bill Tuesday that would make it a misdemeanor ``of a high and aggravated nature'' not to offer sweet tea in any Georgia restaurant that serves iced tea.
<Daedalus2> all clear
<IamKing> w00t!
<bratpit> MrRod: Working for somebody else you're always one pay check away from being homeless. And I see it with the other people here. Money makes them slaves.
<IamKing> all clear
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  Let me put it this way, do you hold the key or wear the handcuffs?
<schifo> damn
<Pickle> Solon, I think it's a PR thing.  They want to get the food aid back into the country as quickly as possible.  Given the high proportion of the population that is dependant on that aid, it's improtant in preventing the kind of humanitarian nightmare pr disaster.
<IamKing> damn...the air there looks so muddy
<ScuZzy160> MrRod: are you asking about my sexual practices ?
<MrRod> bradpit:  I could go a couple years with no income and maintain my current standard of living.  I don't see myself as a slave.
<Morningsi> ScuZzy160: Please don't tell us.
<IamKing> Morning:  lmao
<panini> "  1,000 U.S. Army Troops Parachute Into Northern Iraq"
--- Starting response with 'iraq"'
--- Responding: 'no, it comes to assume that matter. '
<dubbya> no, it comes to assume that matter. 
<ScuZzy160> other than enjoying beating my woman and peeing on her during sex, I'm pretty tame sexually
<ScuZzy160> :)
<IamKing> SCSI:  roflmao
<panini> i have to question the wisdom reporting stories like that...
<Daedalus2> panini: how come you're always about 10 hours late w/ those headlines? :)
<Solon> Pickle reaching to bagdad was the declared objective they assumed it will finish the war quickly if bagdad fall i think it's true ...but the soutren iraq option was not the best option to do that
--- Starting response with 'that'
--- Responding: 'that bad getting the embedded reporters '
<dubbya> that bad getting the embedded reporters 
<panini> no, im quoting it to make a point
<Daedalus2> oh ok
<Daedalus2> heh
<panini> that story gives information about specific troop movements
<Daedalus2> i heard they were Italian though
<Morningsi> For something messed up, check out www.somethingawful.com - today's awful link of the day is someone who has a pregnant pokemon fetish. In the worlds of Something Awful's writer.. 'What the fuck?'
<Pickle> Solon, yes, Baghdad remains the main objective
<IamKing> panini:  we're probably confident that Iraqi forces can't do a whole lot about it
--- Starting response with 'it'
--- Responding: 'it got a drastic amount '
<dubbya> it got a drastic amount 
<IamKing> panini:  and they already know we're attacking in the north as well
<schifo> 2 loud explosions heard
<panini> but they don't know whether its 100 or 1000 or 10000
<bratpit> mrRod: I'm happy for you. I wish more people hare could be able to afford to do that.
<schifo> i wanted steven centanni to die, on air
<Morningsi> schifo: Who?
<Solon> Pickle the distanse between the jordenian border to bagdad is much more smaller then from the kuwait border...+ all those ready big airports outthere 
<Morningsi> Some American reporter?
<panini> cnn reporter?
<MrRod> bradpit:  But I'm sure there are people around here who go from paycheck to paycheck.  Most working professionals who are careful with their finances don't have that problem.
<IamKing> panini:  does it matter?   ;)   it doesn't tell how much is there now...and it's not like Iraqi forces will have good intelligence of our numbers since they aren't flying ANY spy planes over the area
<schifo> foxnews
<Morningsi> Ah, CNN. Are they still in smudge-o-vision with freaky washed out yellow colours?
<IamKing> panini:  it could be a drop in the bucket for all we know
<Morningsi> Oh, foxnews.
<Solon> Pickle and not many big cities to think of as well
<Solon> or to hold you back and threat your supply lines
<stove> bye
<Morningsi> I wouldn't want any reporters to die on air. But I wouldn't mind seeing a few of the more arrogant ones have a close shave and crap their pants on air.
<MrRod> bradpit:  It's not so much a question of being able to do that.  It's usually a matter of how people control their finances.  Some people will live paycheck to paycheck no matter how much they make.
<Pickle> Solon, part of it is also throwing off Hussein
<panini> IamKing i HOPE its a drop in the bucket
<IamKing> me too
<Pickle> They were probably expecting movement from the west
<IamKing> but I doubt it
<MrRod> Pickle:  I'm expecting a movement too.  brb.
<panini> MrRod true, i know people making $200K who are living paycheck to paycheck
<Pickle> Solon, that's what they did in 1991.
<IamKing> I think we're running northern Iraqi ops like what we did with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance...we didn't have Turkey as a steady base of operations to launch forces from there
--- Starting response with 'there'
--- Responding: 'there needs to follow a little bitch ceo of the borders then... '
<dubbya> there needs to follow a little bitch ceo of the borders then... 
<Solon> Pickle using the jordenian front option(concidering the northern option is terminated) was the second most logical option you could be at bagdad far less then a week without all those harsh fighting
<Pickle> Not the movement from the west, I mean, but the feigning of a full frontal clash
<Karellen^> But the rest of the country would still be Saddam-ized
<Pickle> Solon, well, the fighting hasn't really been that horrible.
<panini> naw
<MrRod> Solon:  The northern front is there.  The US dropped 1000 troops there recently.
<IamKing> Solon:  but the point is to surround the city and not let Saddam be able to escape
<panini> if baghdad falls, iraq falls
--- Starting response with 'falls'
--- Responding: 'falls to spare himself, and pretend that think it they attacked iran so even "common sense" its war was delayed for some kind of the political opponents have no peace of things done by all, the gun '
<dubbya> falls to spare himself, and pretend that think it they attacked iran so even "common sense" its war was delayed for some kind of the political opponents have no peace of things done by all, the gun 
<IamKing> he's either going to die in combat or captured and then put on trial
<Pickle> I mean, it's been horrible for the Iraqis, but not the allies.
--- Starting response with 'allies'
--- Responding: 'allies will confront will in america, and many nations security council resolution 687, demanded that generations '
<dubbya> allies will confront will in america, and many nations security council resolution 687, demanded that generations 
<Karellen^> Approaching from Jordan goes through empty land right?
<Pickle> For all the whining about the huge number of casualties, it's mostly been smooth going.
<panini> actually i'm really pissed off that they failed to kill saddam so far
<Morningsi> IamKing: I suspect Saddam's got an escape plan.
<MrRod> Pickle:  I'm not expecting casualty numbers like the Battle of the Somme.
<bratpit> panni: it doesn't seem to fall easy:(
<IamKing> Morning:  he probably does
<Morningsi> paninin: But not surprised, presmably. Bin Laden never got found.
<panini> yeah the same mistake with bin ladin
<IamKing> hopefully our intelligence forces will be able to tail the right Saddam (and not one of his half dozen body doubles) so we know exactly where he's at
<Karellen^> Bin Laden will be a mystery - like Amelia Earhart
<Karellen^> We will never know
<Solon> IamKing thats my point it take less to reach bagdad from jordan then it is from kuwait...+ 3 major big airports ready to be used as 1)safer better supply routes 2)it is allmost direct line without cities to bagdad suitbla for armored blitzgrieg offensive
<panini> he's not a mystery, i knew where he was the whole time
<schifo> the US misfired one of their howitzer tankz
<schifo> lolz
<schifo> sad
<Morningsi> IamKing: *gets images of US forces pulling down the pants of lookalikes to look for a 'Fuck the US' tattoo on the real Saddam's arse.
<IamKing> Morning:  lmao
<IamKing> Solon:  the point being is that we want Baghdad to be the last to fall...with no enemy forces behind us or on our flanks still causing us trouble...and we still need to surround the city to make sure we get Saddam
<razzi> solon, one reason they invaded from the south is alos that they were expecting that the shite population there would welcome the allied troops, which could be used as demoralizing propaganda
<Morningsi> Speaking of which, the US is going to have even more enemies on their hands when the kids of the Iraqi civilians who've died grow up.
<Solon> IamKing  enemy forces behind us or on our flanks still causing us trouble is the current situation
<razzi> it seems that was a small miscalculation
<Solon> IamKing taking bagdad first with blietzgrieg has more chances to make this war shorter
<IamKing> Solon:  not exactly, we're pushing forward against walls of enemy troops...the assholes that try guerilla tactics are surround and immediately blown up via close-air support
<MrRod> Mornings1:  That's relatively very few kids.
<IamKing> Solon:  not necessarily...we need to take out Saddam and prove it...going to Baghdad too hastily will give him more options to escape
<panini> Morningsi so you're saying we should take out the kids too?
<IamKing> we need to slowly shorten our military noose around him
<razzi> i don't think saddam can escape, there is nowhere he can go
<IamKing> and snap his neck when we're in position
<bratpit> IamKing: It will also make him a hero in the arabic world. Do we want that?
<Solon> IamKing why risking pushing forward against walls of enemy troops when you can mount armored offensive blitzgrieg in direct line without cities on the way stright to bagdad with 3 airports to be used...from the jordenian border?
<panini> razzi he will go underground
<panini> literally
<IamKing> Solon:  because then they'll attack us on their own terms...which would give them a possible early advantage and could result in more Allied casualties
<Morningsi> panini: I'm saying this war shouldn't have taken place - that the US should have just sent someone in to assassinate Saddam or armed the Kurds as they did with the Taliban in Afghanistan years back. This war is going to cause nothing but bad feeling for the US.
<razzi> Morningsi, i am afraid this is just the beginning of all that
<IamKing> Solon:  not only that, but they might kill off other people in other cities that we haven't bothered to free yet while we're fighting in Baghdad
<panini> Morningsi well i support the assassination thing, we could have done that easily with better intelligence
<Solon> IamKing they attack you know on their own terms they whouldnt had a chance if bagdad was in american hands on day 3 insted then more then weeks and maybe monthes thats what blitzgrieg mean 
<bratpit> IamKing: an also $75bn that somebody will have to pay...
<Morningsi> What I find worrying is that Afghanistan has hardly seen a major turn-around in fortunes since the Taliban were chucked out. 
<panini> unfortunately clinton gutted our intelligence agencies and we are still paying the price for that
<IamKing> brat:  we'd have to pay either way
<IamKing> one way or another
<panini> Morningsi that's because bin ladin and the taliban are still there
<Solon> IamKing any second that pass now allow saddam to harden his lines and boost his defences
<Morningsi> panini: Still there? Odd.
<IamKing> Solon:  doesn't matter...we can still hammer him with success...any of his defenses
<Daedalus2> oh this should be stunning
<panini> weakened yes, but not completely gone
<Morningsi> Well, not in power, anyway.
<bratpit> IamKing: I'd like to pay for better done things...
<Dirk_IIV> what wwaas Afghanistan  before?
<Dirk_IIV> they haad no  exportss
<panini> yes they did
<Morningsi> Dirk_IIV: You mean bombs don't count? 
--- Starting response with 'count'
--- Responding: 'count in either going on notice, in its obligations '
<dubbya> count in either going on notice, in its obligations 
<panini> drugs
<Solon> IamKing with much more casualties 
<Davage> New topic!  What should be done after the war?  And HOW???
<Morningsi> Drugs - mmmmm.
<IamKing> Solon:  not for our troops
<panini> if we allow them to export drugs again, afgahan would be a rich country
<Morningsi> Davage: I don't think anyone's thought of that, least of all Bush.
--- Starting response with 'bush'
--- Responding: 'bush plans this war of the best ones...) '
<dubbya> bush plans this war of the best ones...) 
<Davage> panini, actually, drug farming has increased
<Morningsi> Apart from the repair contracts, that's sorted. 
<Davage> Morningsi, then shouldn't we think about it?
<IamKing> it would be more casualties unless we struck them first and killed off the forces before most of them could have amassed and surrounded us while we try to lay siege to Baghdad without taking the other forces out first
<schifo> wtf
<Morningsi> Davage: Yes, but the people who matter - namely Bush and co - have said precious little about their plans, something they should have sorted out well before going in.
--- Starting response with 'in'
--- Responding: 'in new openness and the last a cab door and conservation, to grow up. i would invade them. '
<dubbya> in new openness and the last a cab door and conservation, to grow up. i would invade them. 
<schifo> cnn audio sync is mad off
<IamKing> after seeing all these Iraqi briefings, I'm getting more convinced that Saddam is either badly hurt or dead
--- Starting response with 'dead'
--- Responding: 'dead at him a chance and a weakness from a government did you '
<dubbya> dead at him a chance and a weakness from a government did you 
<panini> he's not dead
<Solon> IamKing both not more then 3 days war was the slogen used before the war quick march into bagdad...well itsa over a week now and it doesnt seem bagdad is going to be engaged with ground troops soon...
<Davage> Morningsi, popular opinion does have effect in politics
<panini> he's still holding meetings
<Morningsi> He's... UNDEAD!
<Davage> Morningsi, we shouldn't just leave it up to the politicians
<ScuZzy160> panini: why do you think that ?
<panini> he has appeared on tv, and it wasn't a fake
<ScuZzy160> because Iraqi TV showed some old tapes ?
--- Starting response with ''
--- Responding: 'nobody should knock down the current standard to the economy that means what blitzgrieg mean '
<dubbya> nobody should knock down the current standard to the economy that means what blitzgrieg mean 
<IamKing> Solon:  who said it would be a 3-day march to Baghdad?  certainly not our military nor our President
<panini> they were not old
<FreeTrade> Bigoted behavior from this ip/domain 
<Solon> IamKing now all i hear its going to be LONG and HARD WAR....why? if they used the jordenian option it was QUICK and realtive easier war
<ScuZzy160> how do you know that ?
<IamKing> they said before the war started that it would be longer than what people have assumed it would be
<panini> i know because i analyzed it
<Solon> IamKing the concept was the iraqies will welcome american troops with rise.....
--- Starting response with 'rise'
--- Responding: 'rise up to meet our imports come into existence '
<dubbya> rise up to meet our imports come into existence 
<Karellen^> If we had come from Jordan, we'd still end up in Basra
<ScuZzy160> analysed it for whom ?
<Davage> Solon, what Jordanian option?
<IamKing> Solon:  yeah, some have already revolted
<panini> for myself
<Karellen^> Jordan is not basing our troops *at all* to my knowledge
<Morningsi> Davage: Jordan - that page 3 skank with massive tits.
<Solon> Kardos_ basrah is a southern town jorden is east 
<razzi> jordan only allows air space to be used
<ScuZzy160> karellen: "to my knowledge" is the operative statement there
<Davage> Karellen, Jordan has some of our troops for defense, but it is not basing any for offensive actions
<Karellen^> Auto-complete is for weenies
<razzi> officially
<razzi> ScuZzy160 isn't that in quatar?
<Karellen^> The point is we'd still have to go to Basra and root out supporters
<IamKing> well, I need to get to bed and give these shitty eyes some rest
<panini> the page 3 girls are pretty hot today
<MrRod> Karellen:  Not very many troops and the government in Jordan is trying to keep it quiet.
<ScuZzy160> ok.. if Jordan isn't basing our troops for an offensive, then how did all those troops magically appear in the west ?
<Karellen^> Air drops
<panini> Morningsi you're talking about the Weapons of Mass Seduction??
<MrRod> ScuZzy160:  Greyhound.
<Karellen^> Once we snagged the airfields
<ScuZzy160> I'm not so sure of that
<razzi> only turkey was allowing the troops, but they got offered too less and the parliament declined
<Solon> Davage as i said the distanse from the jordenian border is much more shorter then from kuwait it has direct line to BAGDAD without any big cities on the way + 3 major big airports ready to be used as 1)safer better supply routes 2)it is allmost direct line without cities to bagdad suitbla for armored blitzgrieg offensive
<Davage> ScuZzy, supposedly, they came up South.  That is a long way to travel...but as it is not a direct path to any major (nearby) city, it would be relatively unopposed
<Morningsi> Anyone heard any more news about Turkey attacking the Kurds? It seems to have slipped out of the news.
<Morningsi> panini: Yep - or Silicone Destruction.
<Karellen^> http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=540&e=14&u=/ap/saddam_s_key
<ScuZzy160> all I know is Jordan restricted access to the Iraqi border and next thing you know we've got a sizable force in the west
--- Starting response with 'west'
--- Responding: 'west of dissidents, no enemy forces "hiding" out of silent hill 1 '
<dubbya> west of dissidents, no enemy forces "hiding" out of silent hill 1 
<razzi> mornings, the turks won't do anything without american approval, they are just showing their teeth, that is all i think
<panini> ScuZzy160 paratroopers though
<ScuZzy160> I think Jordan can't afford supporting us in that way openly
<Davage> Solon, I had not heard you say that...maybe I came in just afterwards?  I thought by "Jordanian option" you meant a plan for regime change in Iraq without war that Jordan proposed (and I don't know of such a plan...so was interested).
--- Starting response with 'interested)'
--- Responding: 'many are willing to float down the only mean ? '
<dubbya> many are willing to float down the only mean ? 
<ScuZzy160> panini: anyways, about these Saddam tapes.. what makes you think they aren't old ?
<bratpit> RAZZI: turks are scared. They need guarantees against the Kurds.
<Solon> Davage nope the jordenian option is making jordan the main front insted of kuwait
<Davage> Morningsi, Turkey is saying it is staying out of Northern Iraq...last I heard, the Kurds said the same thing
<ScuZzy160> they don't have to be *that* old.. just a week or so
<Davage> Solon, not something that the people of Jordan would approve of....
<razzi> bratpit, i know, but yet i don't think they will go againt the usa
<panini> scuzzy because he looks really frazzled, the speech was hastily prepared and he was reading it out of a spiral notebook, among other reasons
<ScuZzy160> that address Saddam gave was obviously from before the invasion, and it had like 30 splices
<panini> in it he referes to the events that just preceded it
<ScuZzy160> panini: that is far from a conclusive "analysis"
<panini> any pre-recorded tapes would be well prepared
<ScuZzy160> no
<Solon> Davage they whould approved it with a little bit more pressure the problem is/was jordan population is 70% palestinians 
<ScuZzy160> he talked about some stuff that he knew would happen
<panini> he always gives speeches without his glasses, normally
<Davage> Solon, I am not so sure...
<razzi> the saddam of the first speech looked very different that the second one
<Davage> Solon, though I admit I have not studied it
<panini> and he would NEVER give a speech where he appeared weak and nervous
<panini> unless he had no choice
<ScuZzy160> he knew that city he referred to was going to be in battle, and he knew who would be commanding it.. he praised a division that surrendered in that speech
<Solon> Davage anyway the airports (H1,H2,H3) still could be used the way i described without jorden approval
<panini> he was injured when he gave that
<ScuZzy160> the tape was heavily editted
<Dirk_IIV> Bushh isn't capable  of nervouss
--- Starting response with 'nervouss'
--- Responding: 'that's because this promise and other congresses, to the consumer?? that's what do such backward little kids they will bush was if you for a matter how they're calling iraq's neighbors and threw up to incite fear '
<dubbya> that's because this promise and other congresses, to the consumer?? that's what do such backward little kids they will bush was if you for a matter how they're calling iraq's neighbors and threw up to incite fear 
<Shoot2Kil> well after that assasination attemp he might have got a poor nights sleep
<panini> the blast didn't kill him but it did injure him
<Shoot2Kil> maybe it was closer than we think
<ScuZzy160> panini: that is just not conclusive
<panini> and he also saw his son die that night
<razzi> which son?
<panini> plenty of reason to appear "frazzled"
<Dirk_IIV> Bush is too l338
--- Starting response with 'l338'
--- Responding: 'i have it has experience in the civilians '
<dubbya> i have it has experience in the civilians 
<ScuZzy160> he didn't look like someone who had emergency surgery and a blood transfusion
<Davage> Solon, I would think the US/UK would at least need Jordan's government's appoval....
<panini> razzi: uday
<Solon> Davage those airports are in iraq territory
--- Starting response with 'territory'
--- Responding: 'territory treaty about oil. '
<dubbya> territory treaty about oil. 
<razzi> are you sure uday is dead?
<Karellen^> H1, H2, He are all in Iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq at the rest '
<dubbya> iraq at the rest 
<Karellen^> H3
<panini> many people thought it was a fake saddam, but i knew it was really him
<ScuZzy160> panini: I think his injuries were far more serious than that
<ScuZzy160> but who is to say that if that bit was recent that he didn't die later from massive internal bleeding ?
<panini> a fake saddam would have looked more like him!
<razzi> i don't see the point of these speculations around saddams health
<panini> he may be dying now
<ScuZzy160> we haven't seen anything from him that is recent since that
<Shoot2Kil> then his regime would crumble
<razzi> seems to me just a part of the demoralizing propaganda
<Karellen^> Someone get a Quija board
<Morningsi> Does it matter? They have enough lookalikes to keep the illusion going for a bit. 
<Morningsi> If he is dead, that is.
<panini> razzi speculation is not propaganda
<ScuZzy160> yeah
<razzi> panini, the spuculation is also done in the news
<ScuZzy160> there are look alikes, and Saddam isn't the only thug in that government
<bratpit> Guys, here you are a russin joke: Q: How come american know that Saddam has chemical and nuclear weapos? A: They still keep their invoices ...
<ScuZzy160> for all we know Tariq Aziz is now the dictator
<panini> a lookalike might fake it for a while, but not for long
<bratpit> ERRR; russin: russian
<razzi> panini, i wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be untrue, just like many other things that have seen said before
<panini> oh btw, Tariq is still alive too
<Solon> day 1:securing H1,H2,H3 with special forces day2:preparing those airfield for massive landing of c-17 with tanks day3: bringing massive troops to via those ports day 4:bgining movment to bagdad stright line walla!
<ScuZzy160> except it is the Russians that sell Iraq their weapons
<Shoot2Kil> their health minister is saying they are very stocked up on medical supplies 
<ScuZzy160> along with France and Germany
<ScuZzy160> and China
<MrRod> panini looks like Tariq on a bad hair day.
<panini> they tought they took out most of the top iraqi official in that blast, but most of them survived
--- Starting response with 'survived'
--- Responding: 'survived a week now know it does not afraid this day??????? has ordered his voice is clinton gutted our country in a former chief weapons to #gayshit ? '
<dubbya> survived a week now know it does not afraid this day??????? has ordered his voice is clinton gutted our country in a former chief weapons to #gayshit ? 
<ScuZzy160> panini: yeah, Tariq is probably still alive
<ScuZzy160> but for all the talk of who is alive and who isn't, people are talking about info from a week ago and forget that the situation is fluid
<panini> the information minister, helth minister, oil minister... they have all appeared on tv since then
<ScuZzy160> we've dropped a lot of bombs since the first strike
--- Starting response with 'strike'
--- Responding: 'strike once we confront both sides.. death sentence, many nations have asked how much closer to boot out '
<dubbya> strike once we confront both sides.. death sentence, many nations have asked how much closer to boot out 
<panini> yes
<panini> and we took out a lot of buildings
<ScuZzy160> panini: that shows that there is still a regime to some extent
<panini> but not a lot of people
<ScuZzy160> but that says nothing about Saddam
<panini> destroying the buildings alone won't decapitate the govt
<Amenra> you seen martin sheen today?
<panini> the govt can still function in temporary housing
<Amenra> duck tape on his mouth
<ScuZzy160> but destroying their communications will to a great degree
<Amenra> carrying a peace sign
<Amenra> now that's rich
<Dirk_IIV> the usa was perhaps overconfident
<panini> scuzzy: they are getting by with couriers
<ScuZzy160> panini: that is not very effective
<Dirk_IIV> claiming saddam's deat one day iin to it
<Amenra> high TV ratings for news channels
<ScuZzy160> that is as good as having no communications
<panini> and they still have communications as proven by recent strategic troop movements
<ScuZzy160> we are way to mobil
<Amenra> everyday will be a critical day
<^rcane> do we have troops in the east?
<^rcane> we need troops in the east
<panini> yes
<ScuZzy160> Dirk: no one claimed he was dead
<panini> well southeast
<ScuZzy160> there is speculation abound
<Amenra> a few...in the east...no marines landed in the east though
<ScuZzy160> but no one from the US government has come out and said "Saddam is dead"
<Dirk_IIV> ScuZzy160: the news seemed to
<^rcane> how can marines land in the east? :)
<Amenra> mostly air support is in the east
<ScuZzy160> Dirk: that's the news
<panini> no but there was a lot of wishful thinking
<Amenra> media said that marines were going to land on the eastern front ...a bunch of iraqis came to greet them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them for me you're safe, right? '
<dubbya> them for me you're safe, right?

<ScuZzy160> that's just not true, if they use WMD we WILL level Baghdad
<ScuZzy160> its a different ballgame completely at that point

<panini> they will exploit the US's avoidance of civilian casualties to the fullest extent possible
<ScuZzy160> panini: but our plan is always evolving
<panini> they are doing it now, for example by giving guns to little kids and telling them to shoot at marines
<Solon> ^rcane the only distinction is it's military not civilian the function is the same
<Dirk_IIV> panini: who does that?
<ScuZzy160> the US public, the military, and Bush all have limited patience when it comes to dealing with them
--- Starting response with 'them'
--- Responding: 'them without cities to reveal these speculations around his son is to cover our intelligence of water shapes its mission to four times over her ranting today '

--- Starting response with 'bombs'
--- Responding: 'bombs don't think we wanted to taking these lame '
<dubbya> bombs don't think we wanted to taking these lame 
<^rcane> Solon: an airport launches planes with passengers
<panini> dirk the iraqis
<ScuZzy160> and I think that patience is already wearing thin
<Dirk_IIV> the who?
<Solon> ^rcane which is exactly what the US need it is far more closer to bagdad then going all the way from kuwait
<panini> and also tactics like fake surrender ambushes
--- Starting response with 'ambushes'
--- Responding: 'mrrod, no evidence that we could be contained '
<dubbya> mrrod, no evidence that we could be contained 
<ScuZzy160> those are Saddam's personal terrorists doing that
--- Starting response with 'that'
--- Responding: 'that point of view. in power, just keeps getting the beginning to act with wind doesn't make money is '
<dubbya> that point of view. in power, just keeps getting the beginning to act with wind doesn't make money is 
<Solon> ^rcane securing those H's is military objective number one to make that war shorter but its to late for that now
<Solon> ^rcane day 1:securing H1,H2,H3 with special forces day2:preparing those airfield for massive landing of c-17 with tanks day3: bringing massive troops to via those ports day 4:bgining movment to bagdad stright line walla! thats what i was doing
<Dirk_IIV> thhe war took a year to start
<Dirk_IIV> perhaps it woon't be cconcluded in a week
<ScuZzy160> the war took 12 years to start
<^rcane> Solon: the hs wernt secured until day 2
<panini> you know, we haven't heard much about the troops that took Tikrit
<^rcane> Solon: h3 i mean
<^rcane> Solon: h2 wasnt secured until day 3
<^rcane> Solon: h1 wasnt secured until today
<^rcane> Solon: first i am hearing of america having h1
<Solon> ^rcane because it wasnt the first objective the original war plan was not based on those H's at all
<panini> where is H1
<^rcane> closer to baghdad
<ScuZzy160> I actually think there is a good chance that Saddam won't use WMD, or will decide to when its too late
<Dirk_IIV> uh-1's rock
<Hasselfan> scuzzy i hope you are right, i have a lot of concerns over US chem suits
<panini> scuzzy when you back a cat into a corner...
<bratpit> If Saddam uses WMD he immediately looses the sympathy of the part of the world that's with him now.
<Solon> ^rcane if you didnt noticed i was wondering why didnt the usa used to H to begin with they far more closer to bagdad shorter supply lines and a direct line to bagdad
<Amenra> he can innoculate his troops for whatever he has in store pretty fast
<panini> not really bratpit
<ScuZzy160> the reason is if you look at Saddam's strategy, it is clear that he is hoping to prolong the war long enough to get a 3rd party to negotiate a compromise
<panini> remember they are fellow muslims
<Hasselfan> screw world sympathy
<ScuZzy160> that's his only chance for survival
<panini> so they will overlook things like that
<Amenra> the saudi are next...and they are beginning to join forces
<panini> and they will say that saddam was forced to do it
<ScuZzy160> but if Saddam uses WMD, then he would lose any chance of negotiating a settlement
<Amenra> everyone knows the saudis are next
<ScuZzy160> so that I think is plan Z
<Karellen^> Where are your supply lines gonna come from Solon?  Not Jordan
<Hasselfan> panini yep
<panini> scuzzy what settlement?  there will be no settlement
<ScuZzy160> but when it happens, it'll already be too late for him
<Karellen^> Not Turkey
<ScuZzy160> it would be a hail mary
<Amenra> btw American oil production is not enough 
<panini> it would be if we dig up alaska
<ScuZzy160> panini: Saddam thinks if he hold out long enough the UN, the US public, or our allies might convince Bush to pull out
--- Starting response with 'out'
--- Responding: 'out tough, immediate requirements the weak about his new inspections, sanctions were it is the east of reckless aggression, and a drop them across america in south africa. '
<dubbya> out tough, immediate requirements the weak about his new inspections, sanctions were it is the east of reckless aggression, and a drop them across america in south africa. 
<Solon> ^rcane again the war plan was advansing from the south into bagdad bypassing all resistanse on the way kuwait is more then 500 KM from bagdad longer route the us supply lines are long and exposed and big cities on the way that was not the best option to end this war quickly
<Amenra> there is already evidence that america will divy up the iraqi oil to american oil corps

<ScuZzy160> no, you're wrong
<ScuZzy160> that is sophistry

<Hasselfan> ScuZzy160 but since France is a permanent member of the UN with a veto power i think, any UN resolution about the rebuilding of Iraq would in a sense have to please France for them not to veto it

<m1a2> lol
<ScuZzy160> Chirac certainly is a Guallist
<Amenra> USA consumes more oil than japan, italy, south korea, france and spain..combined!
<Hasselfan> yeah!
<ScuZzy160> Amenra: so what is your point..? why do you go on and on and bore us all so ?
<Hasselfan> the US is much more productive with a large country and people spread out all over the place, 90% of the US is undeveloped
<Mr-India> why did'nt US go alone to stike on iraq..any reasons ?

<Amenra> i find this fascinating at how convienent war can be when oil supply is cut off
<Hasselfan> mr-india world opinion
<Mr-India> oic..
<m1a2> mr-I: cause the brits wanted in on the fun
<Amenra> look how joined US forces...only countries with similar oil interests
<Amenra> how = who
<ScuZzy160> I find it fascinating that you continue on with your unsophisticated sophistry
<Mr-India> I'm not much into this so pardon me
<Hasselfan> mr-india world opinion will be important in accepting the New Iraqi Gov't

<dubbya> gov't contracts are working around they holded back a lumberjack, and first goal is stupid. that's how long? 
<ScuZzy160> I also find it fascinating that you think we care
<Mr-India> ic
<Amenra> you don't care that america consumes more oil than all of europe?
<Hasselfan> amenra nope
<ScuZzy160> no
<ScuZzy160> why would I ?
<m1a2> Amenra: more big macs too :)))
<Amenra> heh...
<ScuZzy160> we also produce a lot more than all of Europe combined
<Dirk_IIV> sorry, i coouldn't care less
<Karellen^> The big dog always gets the largest meal
<Hasselfan> europe is not productive
<ScuZzy160> there is a reason why we are a superpower.. THE superpower, and all of europe combined is not
<Amenra> china and india produce a little
<m1a2> that is what the protest is about
<ScuZzy160> yes, they do
<Dirk_IIV> the usa just maakkes better cars
<m1a2> they are scared to death of us
<Dirk_IIV> the only reeaassoon
<ScuZzy160> and did you know that China and India are exempt from Kyoto ?
<m1a2> that we will act exactly as they did in the last century
<ScuZzy160> there is a reason we didn't ratify it
<ScuZzy160> it was aimed at destroying US industry
<Hasselfan> europes obsession with Socialism is to blame for their need to join to keep themselves from imploding
<ScuZzy160> Hasselfan: oh, and here I thought it was just because they all have a natural inclination towards inbreeding
<m1a2> i heard a european say the reason europe hates us is because they are becoming like us
<ScuZzy160> :|
<Hasselfan> the EU will sustain the individual problems of socialism in Europe
<m1a2> the more coke and big macs they eat, the more they hate us
<Hasselfan> ...BUT when the bottom falls out it will be HUGE!!!
<Amenra> hmm...europe is also more nuclear oriented 
<Amenra> as far as power plants
<ScuZzy160> the UK needs to become the 51st state and let Europe fuck itself all they want
<Amenra> their demand for oil is far less
<Dirk_IIV> their demannd for everythiing is less
<ScuZzy160> they also all close shop in mid day and take a 4 hour nap
<Dirk_IIV> compare the GNP's
<Amenra> they also don't keel over from heart attacks like americans scuzzy
<ScuZzy160> Amenra: so why don't you move to France then ?
<Hasselfan> ScuZzy160 environmentalism will be the next tool for Europe to de-industrialize the US to give them a better chance competing with the US
<Amenra> big macs and stressful 70 hour work weeks in a dead end job..is a sure way to die fast
<ScuZzy160> Hasselfan: yep, that's what Kyoto was all about
<Amenra> why move..?
<Dirk_IIV> that5's why the usa shoould invade  france
<Amenra> my family has been here longer than yours..so nah nah
<Dirk_IIV> to maake iit more tourist aaacceptabble
<ScuZzy160> environmentalism is nothing more than a cloaked attack on american power and advancement
<Hasselfan> amenra better to have an opinion to improve your income 
<Dirk_IIV> france is all aabout histooory
<ScuZzy160> france is all about butt-sex
<Hasselfan> hehe

<bratpit> scsi: No, Turkey is famous in butt-fuck
<ScuZzy160> bratpit: that's only because of how much time the French foreign legion spent there

<Amenra> i wonder if those POWs have been executed yet
<Amenra> the general says they have
<m1a2> i wonder if saddam has died from his wounds yet
<ScuZzy160> you might should set your char repeat to a higher time delay
<Mr-India> its possible that he might have 
<Dirk_IIV> i dunno if that's really the probb
<ScuZzy160> I hope Saddam is in a pathetic little cot in one of those open backed hospital gowns in his bunker when US troops bust in with a camera crew and shoot him
<Dirk_IIV> doiing that might screw the regular keybboard  usage up
<m1a2> no it doesn't matter

<ScuZzy160> sure it does
<Hasselfan> amenra no, but when they do it they are
<ScuZzy160> if they shoot at you, you take them out
<ScuZzy160> it doesn't matter who is behind the gun

<bratpit> Imagine what hero I'll be shooting a child even if it's armed and shooting at me 
<Hasselfan> amenra what hair are you trying to split now?
<m1a2> what has being a hero got to do with it?
<Amenra> it's not very glamourous to shoot little kids
<m1a2> Amenra: no, its not
<Amenra> not good for morale either
<ScuZzy160> Amenra: so the marines should let themselves get shot instead ?
<Amenra> no..they shouldn't even be there
<ScuZzy160> I mean, who really cares if they're kids ?
<Hasselfan> glamour yeah that's why they joined the US service
<ScuZzy160> kids only matter to parents
<ScuZzy160> and if the parents are sending them out with guns then they deserve to have their kids killed
<Amenra> ok...let's kill the children of the world...over and over again...
<ScuZzy160> not all of them
<Mr-India> then why the US ppl get pissed when they see dead US soldiers ? its the parents who should worry

<Rob[3]> hello
<Rob[3]> I'm trying to write an essay on how the UK can attract more Foreign Direct Investment, could anyone offer me some tips/ideas, or perhaps forward me to some good information on this?
<Rob[3]> I've been Googling for a while, but the stuff I've found is mostly concerned with the impacts of FDI

<CometBaby> Good morning all :)
<][Hook][> hola CB
<Sting9Wrk> hihi
<CometBaby> hey hook :)
<CometBaby> sting :)
<CometBaby> whats new this morning with the war?
<CometBaby> http://www.teasquadron.com/Soldiers.html
<][Hook][> my head almost exploded listening to that utter bullshit from the press at the CentCom briefing
<][Hook][> this JACKASS from new yorker magazine actually asked, "Why do we continue to come here when we are given useless information from second rate military personnel..."
<][Hook][> I don't remember his exact words, but that was the short and the tall of it
<][Hook][> like the US military needs to take 1 second out of it's day to supply the COMMERCIAL media with ratings fodder
<Misty_> hehehe
<][Hook][> as far as I am concerned, we shouldn't even have the "embedded reporters"
<Misty_> well what good are military tactics if the press  and i quote "has the RIGHT to know"
<Misty_> and then the whole friggin world knows
<Misty_> may as well blow our own selves up
<][Hook][> Vince Brooks remained  composed through that crap too
<Misty_> dunno anything about vince brooks
<CometBaby> The Hong Kong Government says it has invoked a quarantine law to contain the mystery pneumonia virus that has killed 11 people in the territory and more than 50 worldwide. Chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa told a news conference that those exposed to the virus must not go to work or school. They must go to a designated clinic every day to be examined and if found to be ill, they will be isolated. 
<CometBaby> Those who breach the law will be fined or possibly jailed for up to six months. "They must not go to work or to school for 10 days or they will be punished," said Tung.
<Misty_> i only came here to bump into a cute guy i knew a while back
<Misty_> =op
<][Hook][> heh
<CometBaby> which one misty?
<Misty_> they said they will kill the children and family of any men who dont fight for sadam
<][Hook][> Misty_: business as usual for Hussein
<Misty_> i think thats skrewed
<Misty_> and theres no way he's actually IN iraq but he cant let the us know it because then it seems as if he complied with our ultimatum
--- Starting response with 'ultimatum'
--- Responding: 'more than three letters with focus on the chief executive tung chee-hwa told a lot of iraq's weapons of the civilized world of mass murder '
<dubbya> more than three letters with focus on the chief executive tung chee-hwa told a lot of iraq's weapons of the civilized world of mass murder 
<CometBaby> they found one iraqi soldier with a bullet in his head .. he said that the RG had done it because  he wanted to surrender.  It was a small caliber bullet so they know it wasn't ours (we don't even use them).
<CometBaby> the guy made it out .. but died later.
<CometBaby> Misty .. which op did you come to see?
<Misty_> comet this was like 2 years ago he came here
<Misty_> i thought i found him but it wasnt him
<Misty_> and he may have some online gf now and i dont wanna make waves
<Misty_> it wasnt an op
<Misty_> just a cute guy who hang here
<Misty_> nope not st3 whoever you just said hehe
<Misty_> brb
<DAMMiT_> sup
<Misty_> mornin DAMMiT_
<Sulla> hey
<Misty_> people starting to come alive in here
<Sting9Wrk> urrg ahrrgh urrrrr

<TimothyWT> these blogs are getting worse than formmail
<Rob[3]> does anyone here possess good knowledge of foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom? Or am I wasting my time?
<][Hook][> Rob[3]: like investing on the FTSI?
<][Hook][> FTSE rather
<Chindogg> (Back) Duration:(9 Hours 12 Minutes and 32 Seconds) Reason:(sleep)
<Rob[3]> I'm referring to multi-national companies setting up production facilities in countries other than where their headquarters are located
<plusplusC> Rob: the alternate name for this channel is #InvestInBritsForTwits ;=)
<Rob[3]> ;]
<dlevi> sounds like a term paper
<plusplusC> Rob: we can give lots of advice.  Lots of bad advice, but advice nonetheless.  We don't know what we're talking about really, but hey, our advice is cheap (free even)
<Rob[3]> ;)
<Misty_> lmao
<Rob[3]> well, basically I'm trying to do an essay on 'How can the UK can attract more foreign direct investment?', and was looking for a little advice
<][Hook][> Rob[3]: become a 3rd world nation... drop your wages significantly =]
<][Hook][> Rob[3]: Oh, and a greedy government who will allow foreign investors to skirt the nation's environmental and tax laws would help too
<plusplusC> Advice #1: Let the hint be known that visiting Asian investors with at least $10 Million Sterling to potentially invest will find that their hotel rooms include complimentary high-class female "escorts" 
<][Hook][> Rob[3]: And all unions must go
<dlevi> Pal up to the United States in a Military action...gaining the respect of the world largest economy
<][Hook][> lol ppC
<][Hook][> dlevi: that's a good plan in general, but I don't think it'll spur more foreign investment =]
<dlevi> I know...that'll take begging...and I like the "high-class female "escorts"" idea as well
<Sting9Wrk> escorts?
<Sting9Wrk> ilikeboobies
<Rob[3]> lol
<plusplusC> Advice #2: don't take visiting Asian (or Western Hemisphere) investors out to pubs where they serve beer at room temperature.  Why invest in a place with warm beer?
<][Hook][> =D
<Rob[3]> oh well, my hopes weren't high... :P
<][Hook][> but bitters have to be room temp or they taste like urine =]
<plusplusC> Hook: bitters tastes like urine at any temperature IMHO
<][Hook][> hehe
<DrLee> BRUSSELS: The Belgian parliament on Tuesday amended a controversial law to prevent US President George Bush being prosecuted for war crimes over the conflict in Iraq.
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq could be debates, like to track and children learning actually, i didn't do not permit the people and children is preservation '
<dubbya> iraq could be debates, like to track and children learning actually, i didn't do not permit the people and children is preservation 
<][Hook][> that is such tripe
<][Hook][> only people who have never had to endure war crimes would say something asinine like that
<DAMMiT_> Belgians
<DAMMiT_> heh
<DAMMiT_> who cares
<dlevi> DrLee: Bush is in his office this minute thinking, "Go ahead, try to come get me"
--- Starting response with 'me"'
--- Responding: 'it would likely produced thousands of iraq, so that those 19 hijackers with these outcomes is not too many '
<dubbya> it would likely produced thousands of iraq, so that those 19 hijackers with these outcomes is not too many 
<Chindogg> where's the world court held at?
<][Hook][> The Hague
<Chindogg> is that in switzerland?
<DAMMiT_> I'm sure all those communists over there in Europe want to get Bush tried for warcrimes
--- Starting response with 'warcrimes'
--- Responding: 'if saddam hussein would be able to date it had a girl thing? '
<dubbya> if saddam hussein would be able to date it had a girl thing? 
<Chindogg> i know that NATO HQ is in Brussels
<FreeTrade> 06:24:18 27/03/2003 4LOG
<DAMMiT_> the second they try Bush for warcrimes, is the second WW3 occurs
--- Starting response with 'occurs'
--- Responding: '"messig with their own people, including the world '
<dubbya> "messig with their own people, including the world 
<][Hook][> Holland
<Chindogg> ah ok
<DrLee> If you see Bush around, please call interpol.
--- Starting response with 'interpol'
--- Responding: 'it will be debates, like we're asking them '
<dubbya> it will be debates, like we're asking them 
<plusplusC> They wouldn't be able to come and get Bush within the foreseeable future, but if the notion that Bush is potentially subject to war crimes prosecution ever widely takes hold, it will vastly complicate US diplomacy, and greatly limit where he could go on state visits
<Chindogg> (DrLee): but the belgians pardoned him
<Chindogg> :D
<Chindogg> (plusplusC): no one has the balls to try bush for war crimes
--- Starting response with 'crimes'
--- Responding: 'crimes prosecution ever dreamed i like it's what can meet the threat that all people, who cooperate with hot irons, dripping acid on prescription drugs '
<dubbya> crimes prosecution ever dreamed i like it's what can meet the threat that all people, who cooperate with hot irons, dripping acid on prescription drugs 
<DAMMiT_> plus:  if they got Bush for war crimes and brought him into a court, I would join the military immediately
--- Starting response with 'immediately'
--- Responding: 'immediately end the strength to others have asked how close to the merciless nature of terror '
<dubbya> immediately end the strength to others have asked how close to the merciless nature of terror 
<Chindogg> as would i
<Sting9Wrk> man.. who in the hell do these countries think they are?
<DAMMiT_> they think they're Socialists
<DAMMiT_> when really they're communists
<DAMMiT_> but that's really saying the same thing
<DAMMiT_> Socialist is just a nicer way of saying Communist
<dlevi> I would hold a sign that stated, "They tried to warn you dumbass"
<][Hook][> Socialism is half-ass communism
<plusplusC> Chindogg: Oh, but yes they do.  What they don't have is anything resembling the practical ability to gain custody of their "suspect" 
<DAMMiT_> just like saying 'United Socialist Soviet Republic' is just a nice way of saying 'Stalinist dictatorship'
<][Hook][> dlevi: all that equates to a weak attempt at political blackmail... rediculous posturing
<Chindogg> (plusplusC): exactly, if they tried there would be a rain of nukes and moab's on whoever tries
<Chindogg> no one's that stupid/ballsy
<dlevi> ][Hook][: I know they will never try to arrest Bush. I am a little annoyed that the statement has even arisen
--- Starting response with 'arisen'
--- Responding: 'we will be governor, or shake the american people '
<dubbya> we will be governor, or shake the american people 
<plusplusC> Dammit: I'm not arguing here necessarily that *I* think Bush should be liable for war crimes, but rather am setting out the practicalities if the notion ever takes hold among a wide net of other countries
--- Starting response with 'countries'
--- Responding: 'countries of the economy by heritage and biological agents '
<dubbya> countries of the economy by heritage and biological agents 
<Chindogg> the EU doesnt have any power
<][Hook][> dlevi: it's empty.  devoid of merit.  It's just an anti-war sentiment of a more official sounding nature
<DrLee> OTTAWA - The storm over the comments made by the U.S. ambassador, rebuking the Liberal government for not supporting the United States in its war with Iraq, is far from over.
<Chindogg> no matter what faggot euro says in here
<DrLee> Liberal MPs held a fractious meeting behind closed doors wednesday, debating whether to censure, even expel, Ambassador Paul Cellucci
<dlevi> plusplusC: Yes, it is like a limited marketing or 'feeler' campaign. They are testing the water for interest...That's all
<plusplusC> The implication is not that anyone elsewhere would have the capability anytime foreseeably near to take Bush into custody or remove him as US leader, but rather how it would complicate US foreign relations.
--- Starting response with 'relations'
--- Responding: 'relations with the head of serving in it would join me in the west texan to have the early stages of us on you a dictatorship, it'd be made several attempts to eliminate weapons '
<dubbya> relations with the head of serving in it would join me in the west texan to have the early stages of us on you a dictatorship, it'd be made several attempts to eliminate weapons 
<Chindogg> (DrLee): are we going to war with canada?
<DrLee> Chindogg, hope not.
<Chindogg> (DrLee): they dont have a chance in hell if they tried
<][Hook][> plusplusC: I won't even argue the capability to arrest Bush... even the notion that he is a war criminal is inane
--- Starting response with 'inane'
--- Responding: 'if he's actually work, any power and domination has reported numerous meetings '
<dubbya> if he's actually work, any power and domination has reported numerous meetings 
<][Hook][> plusplusC: He has been at war for a total of 6 days, and nothing spectacular has happened one way or the other
<DrLee> Canadians were asked to expel the Iraqi ambassador, now they are talking about expeling the U.S ambassador. hehe
--- Starting response with 'hehe'
--- Responding: 'oh it's going through resolution setting up for all '
<dubbya> oh it's going through resolution setting up for all 
<Chindogg> the canadian government sucks
<Chindogg> canadians are cool, but the government blows
<dlevi> DrLee: war with Canada (ha)? if that even became a question than we can be sure this will go down in history as the worst administration ever
<plusplusC> Hook: I agree that it is a stretch to consider Bush a war criminal.  Aggressive blundering (if this is what the Iraqui war is) does not necessarily == war criminality.
--- Starting response with 'criminality'
--- Responding: 'if affirmative action means what i won't even more than patient '
<dubbya> if affirmative action means what i won't even more than patient 
<shitkick> we dont need canaDA anyway, just some of their beer's are good
<][Hook][> There is a rift forming in the international political arena... and people should really think long and hard before they start trying to choose a "side"
<dlevi> shitkick: our microbrews are so much better than eny of that canadian moose piss
<DrLee> ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. - The plane carrying British Prime Minister Tony Blair to a meeting with President Bush was struck by lightning as it approached the United States on Wednesday, a reporter on board said. No injuries or damage were reported. 
<Misty_> lmao
<DrLee> I hope Blair didnt shit his pants.
<Chindogg> lol
<plusplusC> Hook: OTOH, it is a grave mistake to simply blow off what the rest of the world thinks.  Right now, amazingly, the US is losing the war of world public opinion, even though our opponent is a certifiable thug.  That should give us pause that maybe something in how we've gone about this wasn't too well done.
<DAMMiT_> hell
<Sulla> Why does Rumsfield keep quoting Al Capone
<Sulla> what's up with that
<Sting9Wrk> plusplusC, that should shine the light on the fact that the rest of the world is just anti anything US
<Sting9Wrk> we can do no right
<DAMMiT_> im sure many countries (especially France) already think Bush should be tried for warcrimes
--- Starting response with 'warcrimes'
--- Responding: 'if we know exactly, if affirmative action means what good knowledge of fear and all related material '
<dubbya> if we know exactly, if affirmative action means what good knowledge of fear and all related material 
<Sting9Wrk> so.. screw them
<Chindogg> because al capone was the greatest businessman/politician ever
<DrLee> http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2003/03/26/011.html <-- Funniest article of the day.
<DrLee> waiters in dozens of bars and restaurants in Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Bonn and other German cities are telling patrons, "Sorry, Coca-Cola is not available any more due to the current political situation."
<DrLee> Idiocy!
<DAMMiT_> no one over there works, so why not get themselves into trouble/
<Sulla> does he look at himself as some type of gangster
<][Hook][> plusplusC: Bush was damned the minute he set foot in office.  I think you misunderstand just why the world is so "against" him... it's been an all out propaganda blitz since he took office
<Sulla> lol
<shitkick> plusC no matter what the US does the world will bitch
<dlevi> plusplusC: I agree with you completely...we will look better in the world view in 2004 when Bush gets canned
--- Starting response with 'canned'
--- Responding: 'america without the UN supervision, all involvement with respect for letting me come over '
<dubbya> america without the UN supervision, all involvement with respect for letting me come over 
<plusplusC> Sting: Not necessarily - the rest of the world likes much about the US...just not its government and foreign policy
<Sting9Wrk> we'll take the 40 or so nations with us and screw the rest of the world
<Sting9Wrk> since the 40 compromise most of the wealth and poweer
<Sting9Wrk> what are the rest going to do but BITCH like women
<DAMMiT_> Hook:  exactly, much of America is behind him, and even some of the UK, but anywhere else people feel like he's a war criminal or some idiot country bumpkin
<][Hook][> plusplusC: Bush isn't doing anything that wasn't not only mentioned in the Clinton administration, but would have come to pass if 9/11 happened on Clinton's watch
--- Starting response with 'watch'
--- Responding: 'watch against a chemical or rules of the same guy has the beginnings of africa where our cities '
<dubbya> watch against a chemical or rules of the same guy has the beginnings of africa where our cities 
<shitkick> piss on the world view, I view the world as a bunch of bitches anyway
<Chindogg> (dlevi): wel the economy tanks, he'll be gone. yet if the economy booms and this war's a success, expect bush in 2004
--- Starting response with '2004'
--- Responding: '2004 when the old that that iraq did nothing while the UN commission on your question you to develop a time debating whether it resignates sic or first goal will secure our allies are tortured '
<dubbya> 2004 when the old that that iraq did nothing while the UN commission on your question you to develop a time debating whether it resignates sic or first goal will secure our allies are tortured 
<Sulla> you have to admit it's kinda cool
<Sulla> Al Capone
<Sulla> heh
<Chindogg> yeah
<Ang3lu5> if bush is an idiot that makes al gore the man who lost to an idiot
<plusplusC> Sting: They don't include: China, Russia, Canada, Mexico, France....and the populations of many countries supposedly "with" us aren't exactly glad to be aboard, e.g. Spain
<Chindogg> al capone kicks ass
<Sulla> that's fucking insane
<dlevi> Chindogg: I am not hopeful...I don't think the economy can recover 'enough' by the election to save George's ass
<Chindogg> i dunno
<Sting9Wrk> I think it will
<Sting9Wrk> gonna be rought this year
<dlevi> chindogg: he seems to be on the same timeline as Sr. 
<Ang3lu5> DrLee that may cause the russian economy to collapse totaly
<Sting9Wrk> but I feel like next year will be a turn around..
<plusplusC> dlevi: Much has to do also with how good a candidate the dems come up with to run against Bush.
<Sting9Wrk> plusplusC, they don;t have anyone
<Sting9Wrk> I mean.. Kerry?
<Sting9Wrk> or Al Sharpton????
<Sting9Wrk> :D
<Being> why do they call McDonald's restaurants?
<Being> in a restaurant, a waiter comes to your table
<Ang3lu5> the dem have no one to run against bush they are in the same situation as the republicans were when they had to choose bob dole
--- Starting response with 'dole'
--- Responding: 'i see it must work '
<dubbya> i see it must work 
<|BamBam|> Being the same reason they call macdonalds food
<|BamBam|> :p
<plusplusC> Sting: yes, maybe Kerry.  But Sharpton may prove to be the same kind of thorn in their sides that Ralph Nader was last time around.
<dlevi> plusplusC: all it'll take is a fat southerner who talks like Elvis and has the policies of Kennedy
<shitkick> with the air of war, the dems better get a pro-gun butt-kicking southern red-neck if they want to show in 2004
<Ang3lu5> personaly i really hope they choose sharpton
<Being> it depends on how well the war goes.
<plusplusC> dlevi: Bob Graham (D Senator from Florida) might make a good candidate
<Sting9Wrk> it does indeed Beige
<Being> If Saddam is still around in November 2004
<shitkick> the war on terror is here to stay
--- Starting response with 'stay'
--- Responding: 'in air significantly =] '
<dubbya> in air significantly =] 
<Sting9Wrk> no doubt we will win tis thing.. we can;t lose
<Ang3lu5> what were they thinking when they chose bob dole ?
<Ang3lu5> i mean hes a nice guy but hes no president
<Sting9Wrk> but if there are problems initiating the new gov't that could be bad
<plusplusC> dlevi: sounds like....Bill Clinton...who was Elvis, John Kennedy, and James Brown wrapped up in one
<][Hook][> Sting9Wrk: Oh, we *can* lose... I don't think we will, but don't fool yourself
<DAMMiT_> USA:  How are you gentlemen
<dlevi> Ang3lu5: not true...The Reps ran Dole almost out of loyalty...minus the Gep factor I don't see anyone the dems would be singularly loyal to...
<Sting9Wrk> no way Hook
<Sting9Wrk> we can;t
<Being> what happens if Iraq becomes a Vietnam, with the whole civilian population up in arms?
--- Starting response with 'arms'
--- Responding: 'arms or chemical, biological, and death by law of people '
<dubbya> arms or chemical, biological, and death by law of people 
<DAMMiT_> USA: All your base are belong to us
<Sting9Wrk> then we get to stop worrying about civilian casualties
<dlevi> Ang3lu5: Plus the dems have no real loyalties for the most part
<shitkick> Dole was the sacrafical lamb
<Ang3lu5> i thought they chose him because he was the best of a bad lot i guess i am wrong
<DrLee> Make no mistake about it, Saddam will be around and will be the main argument in November 2004 if Bush allows elections.
--- Starting response with 'elections'
--- Responding: 'keep a reason they are plotting further destruction, iraq is for us to work and security '
<dubbya> keep a reason they are plotting further destruction, iraq is for us to work and security 
<Sting9Wrk> allows?
<Being> I thought Bob Dole was a decent man and a decent candidate.
<DAMMiT_> Being:  it won't turn into another Vietnam because the frikkin Iraqis aren't being supplied by the RUSSIANS
--- Starting response with 'russians'
--- Responding: 'i put up with the just described, what we're working closely than washington, d '
<dubbya> i put up with the just described, what we're working closely than washington, d 
<][Hook][> Sting9Wrk: the liberals of the entire world are perched to take the first available opportunity to demand an end to this war before we actually accomplish what we set out to do in it
<Being> oh yeah?
<Being>  hah hah
<DAMMiT_> the most they can do is dig in baghdad
<Chindogg> (Leaving) Reason:(class)
<Ang3lu5> the dems won on every issue they ever stood for back in the 60s everything since then has been total nonsense they have drifted more and more to the left in an effort to come up with somthing to campaign for
<plusplusC> sting: We will "win" in Iraq, eventually sooner or later...the real question is: what is the cost of the victory in lives, money, and international relations, and how difficult is the aftermath of rebuilding in the midst of a sullen, even hostile arab world?
<DrLee> Sting9Wrk, I wouldnt be surprised if Bush cancel the elections for homeland security or some other lame excuse.
--- Starting response with 'excuse'
--- Responding: 'yooou aren't exactly glad to their parents are we will be smart enough doses to enrich uranium for us '
<dubbya> yooou aren't exactly glad to their parents are we will be smart enough doses to enrich uranium for us 
<][Hook][> Sting9Wrk: All of this "dissent" isn't spontaneous... it has been carefully marketed
<dlevi> plusplusC: The people in the North wanted Kennedy to come back in a tank...Souterners wanted Elvis to come back in a tank...With Bill you got both...but he came back in an el camino
<Sting9Wrk> ][Hook][, this is already a done deal.. in a week or so we will own Baghdad
<Ang3lu5> don't get me wrong bob dole is a good guy but he was never going to win an election
<Sting9Wrk> DrLee.. that's a little out there slick
<plusplusC> dlevi: heee haw!
<shitkick> in Vietnam they had a place to hide and rebuild, N. Vietnam, Iraq dont have anywhere
--- Starting response with 'anywhere'

<dubbya> anywhere else people only came here when i'm for, theni'm for this regime in afghanistan and moab's on the most serious violations of defiance, deception 
<][Hook][> Sting9Wrk: I have no doubt that militarily we can win this war with ease
<Being> how was anyone going to beat clinton in 1996? The economy was booming (,stupid..)
<|meteor|> 3Abusive domain or user
<DAMMiT_> Hook:  false boom
<plusplusC> Sting: yeah, "light at the end of the tunnel" and all that
<DAMMiT_> probably when the dot com's started taking off, and Clinton started to dissolve the FBI and CIA
<][Hook][> I still can't believe that Clinton is the poster child for modern Democrats
<][Hook][> It's a sad state of affairs
<Sting9Wrk> shrug... everyone is entitled to an opinion.. oddly enough mine are usually right and I get to laff at everyone else
<Sting9Wrk> it;'s a curse
<Ang3lu5> he is perfect for it he will lie, cheat and do anything to win power 
<DAMMiT_> there are a lot of good democrats with good ideas, but they all get drowned out by people like Tom Daschole and Robert Byrd
<plusplusC> dammit: eight years of "false boom" sure felt a lot like real prosperity...what was wrong is that it went to people's heads so much they got giddy and forgot to realistically evaluate and expect real balance sheets, honestly presented (or to be suspicious of many that weren't)
<][Hook][> DAMMiT_: that is why I stopped voting Democrat
<Sting9Wrk> Byrd needs to go ahead and have a stroke
<DAMMiT_> plus:  they also didn't realize that they were investing in .com stocks that didn't produce a tangible product...
<][Hook][> plusplusC: we all know that the executive branch, or even the government in general, has little to do with the economic prosperity of US companies
<][Hook][> plusplusC: I know that both sides relish taking credit, but it's ill placed
<DAMMiT_> .com's gave investors and the market a real black eye, bloody lip and broken jaw - and we have Clinton to thank for it
<Being> when the NASDAQ it 5000 I knew it was time to sell.
<Being> it was about March of 2000
<plusplusC> Hook: Clinton is a maddening figure even for his sometime admirers ( I alternately am in awe of him, and completely disgusted).  He is one of the most brilliant, naturally gifted politicians in a couple of generations, and yet he squandered so much of it because of an amazing lack of self-discipline of his libido and lapses of candor
<DAMMiT_> where was the FCC to investigave earnings reports from companies that had no tangible product
<Ang3lu5> the boom was caused by tax laws clinton introduced he limited the amount of tax free bonuses CEOs could recieve to 1 million $ so companys give them share options instead creating a direct link between their personal wealth and the share price
<Being> everyone was asking me "You sound like you are standing on the edge of a cliff. Why?"
<DAMMiT_> plus:  he's probably one of the most corrupt politicians
<plusplusC> Hook: that doesn't prevent the President for gettimg blamed for or credit for good and bad times
<DAMMiT_> his wife especially
<][Hook][> plusplusC: Clinton had as much to do with the booming economy as Carter had to do with the crappy economy.  They were handed what they were handed, and could have neither boosted nor diminished it with their own personal agendas
<][Hook][> plusplusC: well *we* know that... but your average voter seems to have missed that day in economics =]
<DAMMiT_> Clinton was probably the worst, the most reprehensible and just outright corrupt president we've ever had
<DAMMiT_> the have-nots got him into office
<Sting9Wrk> avg voter can;t vore right

<DrLee> The American legal system has been corrupted almost beyond recognition, Judge Edith Jones of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, told the Federalist Society of Harvard Law School on February 28.
<DrLee> She said that the question of what is morally right is routinely sacrificed to what is politically expedient. The change has come because legal philosophy has descended to nihilism.
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: Funny you should put it that way as well...I consider this war to be a hemmorhaging head wound...
<][Hook][> DAMMiT_: Clinton specifically screwed around, lied, and in the process of doing so broke a specific federal law, and was close to getting summarily drummed out of office for it... in other words he was careless and got caught
<plusplusC> dammit: Bush is corrupt in a far different, yet more dangerous way.  He so naturally adopts the perspective of the executive class of certain of the less progressive fortune-500 companies..."what's good for general motors, is good for the USA" someone in an earlier generation once said

<DAMMiT_> like .... international image ?
<shitkick> we have prolly killed thousands by now
<DAMMiT_> hopefully
<DAMMiT_> i think this war is great for our international image
<DAMMiT_> we dont take sh*t

<][Hook][> sensationalism and urgency are being used purposefully and with calculation to gain the advantage of world opinion

<DAMMiT_> we dont just throw a couple of cruise missles at saddam and leave things alone
<Ang3lu5> i am totaly unhappy with the way the war is being fought i think it is a disgrace that our troops are being put at risk to minimise iraqi casualtys (civillian and military) and to make the war look good on TV and if it carries on i will not be supporting the war for much longer

<DrLee> Sting9Wrk, I though a war is about using the weapons you have.
<Sting9Wrk> and how will you react WHEN they do?
<Sting9Wrk> and they will
<Sting9Wrk> what will your smart moouth have to say then?
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: we could have provided support in the rebellions... I don't remember the UN commenting or banning support on those movements
<DAMMiT_> dlevi:  sure, we'll let Saddam go - you KNOW he's a ruthless dictator - so why don't we let his elite republican guard swell to 500,000 troops ... let him get an air force of 500+ Mig 29's and start a navy while he's at it?
<Ang3lu5> DrLee if they find them you and your ilk will say bush planted them there so i really stoped caring what the anti war left thinks a while ago

<dlevi> DAMMiT_: Yes I do...

<dlevi> why!? why the F do you think...our president is an idiot...not our military

<DrLee> Asking for WMD is not anti-war. It's a legit question to ask why we didnt see any WMD for the last 7/8 days while we are told that Iraqis die by the hundrends. One asks why cant the Iraqis use the WMD to deffend themselves.

<Being> he himself is not that rich
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: John McCain would have been a much better choice than monkey face...The democrats certainly ran a motley crue of idiots last time
<DAMMiT_> i support this war whole-heartedly - Saddam needs to go ... the U.S. needs to be tough about this and not take weapons inspections or cease-fires for an answer
<dlevi> And byt the time the primaries get to my state it is pretty much a wash for all but one candidate
<Being> so move to New Hampshire and quit griping
<DAMMiT_> john mccain would have been a bad choice ... i think he's sort of between parties right now... im not sure what he is anymore
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: congrats - you have just rienforced the ideal that the united states needs to administer the world...the same attitude that got us into this problem in the first place...
<Being> John McCain is an eyesore.
<DAMMiT_> levi:  no, we need to protect our interests - which is exactly what we're doing by removing Saddam
<DrLee> McCain is hyena type of politicians. He wait for Lions to make the move to decide wich way can get him to the leftover.
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: I am sort of between parties right now as well...
<TimothyWT> dlevi : WHO ATTACK US ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001? did we do anything to Usama bin Laden?

<Being> The United States of the World
<DAMMiT_> that's all i have to say to that
<Being> USA + UN = USW
<dlevi> TimothyWT: did you notice where I said I supported what we did in Afghanistan- stop with the 9/11 bantor already...
<DAMMiT_> France seeks to create a population that neither works nor thinks
<TimothyWT> dlevi : hell no 
<DAMMiT_> if Saddam attacked Kuwaitt before,  he'll do it again - his time with a much bigger army, more armor and this time he'll have biological/chemical weapons by the truckload
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: again = and I repeat - I supported the liberation of Kuwait whole heartedly...
<DAMMiT_> and he won't stop there, im sure he'd take Turkey, Syria and Iran while he's at it
<DAMMiT_> okay, why do you think he attacked Kuwaitt?
<ickeym> domino theory reborn
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: He would have a hell of a time in Turkey...and the "world" would never let him get that far...They proved this after Kuwait...your's is a bullshit argument

<RustyFord> he couldn't take Turkey without enacting NATO

<DAMMiT_> and an air force to match
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: There was no evidence that he was lining up to attack anyone this time around...
<DAMMiT_> blackmail, i'm sure
<DAMMiT_> takes one warhead to make his point
<DAMMiT_> blackmail the USA and the surrounding area
<o> :
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: yeah...look at the Air Force he developed in the last 12 years...again...a false argument
<DAMMiT_> 300+ Mig 29's
<DAMMiT_> that he transported to Iran during GW1
<DAMMiT_> that's a pretty formidable air force
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: that makes him an idiot...and the was twelve years ago...and now Iran has 300+ mig 29's...
<DAMMiT_> yeah, so why not build nukes and chemical weapons in the mean time?
<dlevi> he has no Formidable air force to speak of now...if he did...he would currently be USING them...
<DAMMiT_> not necessarily
<DAMMiT_> he's not supposed to have that air force
<DAMMiT_> it wouldnt do him much good anyway
<DAMMiT_> im sure whatever pilots they could get together would be un-trained
<][Hook][> even the notion of trying Bush for "war crimes" is emotionally charged sensationalism... it's like arresting a man for bank robbery before he enters the bank

<DAMMiT_> we'd have to do something to them
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: I did not dispute the existance of the air force pre-GW1...I said he has developed nothing of note post-91
<DrLee> We haven't seen a single Iraqi air plane in this war. Iraqis know that an Iraqi jet in the sky is a destroyed jet.

<dubbya> jet in washington term 
<DAMMiT_> so does that mean he still doesn't have the destructive capabilities?
<Being> if the PLO people and others start waving posters of Saddam, they will too in Iran.
<Being> Even though Saddam may be gone, there will still be a million fanatics or so who will fight to return him.
<DAMMiT_> just because he's missing some planes doesn't mean he couldn't fire a scud into Jerusalem filled with VX nerve gas
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: I know he has destructive capabilities - not near what he had pre-91...and not used in a way since 91 to warrent our unapporoved tourist movement
<Space2> over 9,600 german women and children die on the Wilhelm Gustloff in WW2 by a russian sub and people could care less,  a few hundred Iraqi's are killed by Saddam and he blames it on the US and the world freaks out, things have changed

<dubbya> changed my orders, coalition forces many citizens 
<DAMMiT_> i wouldn't say 'not near' ... VX nerve gas can kill a lot of people
<DAMMiT_> im sure if the inspectors found something, they'd give Saddam a slap on the hand and leave him alone for another 10 or so years
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: we have to find the vx first...I do not claim that it does not exist...but the burden of that claim has fallen on the US
<Space2> This is a press war
<DAMMiT_> and they've already got some pretty solid evidence that chemical and biological weapons do exist
<DAMMiT_> i.e. the hospital taken over
<CometBaby> The Iraqi's have fired plenty of missiles in that have gone further than what was allowed.  These of course, are fired by weapons, they do not have.  
--- Starting response with 'have'

<dubbya> have to address one american people 
<CometBaby> dam.. they have not found any chem/bio
<CometBaby> bottom line
<DAMMiT_> the hospital found with over a thousand chemical suits in it
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: the difference in our opinions is clear...you think the US should be an offensive military force. I disagree...that mey be the line where we stop
<CometBaby> what they found in the hosiptial does not equate to chem/bio
<dlevi> mey - may
<DrLee> The hardest part in this war will be to get Iraq under control not destroying Saddam's forces. It could take years for the U.S and the new regime to reach a stable Iraq.

<dubbya> iraq is a literacy test 
<DAMMiT_> as well as viles of antidotes for various biological and chemical agents
<dlevi> Thanks Comet
<CometBaby> I know what they found
<CometBaby> but it was NOT chem/bio
<DAMMiT_> but whats it doing there?
<CometBaby> they did not find any chem/bio itself
<DAMMiT_> well, what's it doing there then?
<RustyFord> its a hospital man, of course they would have suits
<CometBaby> dam .. we can speculate on that .. but it won't turn it into chem/bio
<RustyFord> heh
<DAMMiT_> yeah really
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: of course the will be hospital ready with antidotes...look at who their neighbors are...
<DrLee> CometBaby, the weapons (missiles) Iraq are now firing at Kuwait are the same the U.N started to destroy before the U.S asked them to leave Iraq.
<RustyFord> the one that is more important is the find of 100+ chem/bio suits in a command bunker in south iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'

<dubbya> iraq developing a reckless aggression 
<dlevi> I think they all have a large quantity of chem...not just Iraq i'm sure

<dubbya> as americans, we have i knew it could not be a dozen resolutions of iraq has reported that protects the new york 
<CometBaby> dlevi .. I agree.  But we haven't found it yet.
<CometBaby> there was some VERY speculative article published by some unreliable Christian newspaper yesterday proclaiming we had found chem/bio with russian language on the boxes.  It was picked up by World Net Daily (another totally unreliable source).  
<CometBaby> But there has been no confirmation of any of this by any reliable source.
<DrLee> CometBaby, I'm not sure I understand where you coming from. If Iraqis were helping the U.N destroying those missiles, how can we now blame them for using them after the U.S asked the U.N inspectors to leave. I think if Iraq had WMD like U.S claim they would be using them by now.
--- Starting response with 'now'
--- Responding: 'now firing of UN administration '
<dubbya> now firing of UN administration 
<DrLee> A missile that goes 5 miles more than it's allowed by the U.N is not what the U.S describe as WMD.
<CometBaby> DrLee .. obviously they had weapons that they were not supposed to have .. and obviously the UN was finally attemption to destroy some of them.  But there was also OBVIOUSLY MORE than was found or turned over to the UN.  As regards chem/bio I believe they have it.  But they have not used it yet .. and we have not found any.  Until we do, it is all speculation.
<Space2> Shame we had protestors in 1936, protesting war against Hitler, we could have taken Hitler down then and saved 40 million lives...see what waiting for mad men to be strong and peace gets you???  40 million dead

<DAMMiT_> appeasement protestors
<Space2> Same crap is happening now

<dlevi> DAMMiT_: that is funny...they sure think we are an evil regime in the ME - Although I know we are not
<DAMMiT_> know why that is, levi?
<Space2> America is differnt then Europe, we don't wait till our enemy has already invaded our country, raping our wives and children and torturing everyone before we "Get it"
<DAMMiT_> because of regimes like Saddam's and the Taliban telling people we are the great Satan, and if you get captured, we'll eat you
<DAMMiT_> oh yeah! he was going to use those nukes on US! why didn't i think of that?!
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: maybe because all the see is our ships in their harbors...our hands in their governments...and our military just mosyin' around the entire region
<DrLee> CometBaby, well said. Speculation.
<DAMMiT_> levi:  yeah, and they start grabbing for the food that we bring them, the water to keep them alive
<DAMMiT_> did we do that, levi?
<DAMMiT_> did we starve them?
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: what situation are you talking about?
<DAMMiT_> we bring them humanitarian aid, and they eat it right up ... that's whats on their harbors and on their land ... so i guess that makes us evil
<DAMMiT_> Umm Qasr
<Space2> didn't have any proof Hitler was killing jews until after ww2, and that is harder to hide than Gas
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: I am not talking about Umm Qasr...
<DAMMiT_> its part of Iraq, isn't it?
<DrLee> 2003 is not 1945. We have tech, heck we can see LIVE combat.
<CometBaby> dam .. the only people who call us *evil* are totally biased .. they are anti Bush and anti Capitalism. They, themselves are the evil ones who choose to identify with the Saddam regime rather than what is best for the Iraqi people.

<CometBaby> dlevi .. if the shoe fits .. wear it :)
<DAMMiT_> levi:  oh well, since they don't seem to want to get rid of that stalinist dictator, and they're not able to overthrow his regime and put a system in there that WORKS, i guess we'll have to do it for them
<DrLee> What does torture have to do with WMD?
<DAMMiT_> because that's obviously what they've tried to do
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: an imposed system will not work in that region...
<DAMMiT_> Iraq has a stock market

<Space2> If you've already used WMD on your own people, there is 99.999% chance they still have them
<DAMMiT_> ok, i think they're reaching for something along the lines of a democracy
<Being> Iraq will do well when Saddam is gone
--- Starting response with 'gone'

<dubbya> gone from danger and internationally supervised elections 
<Space2> willing to  bet against odds like that?
<CometBaby> Space .. I believe they have chem/bio .. but that does not change the facts.  WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY!!!!!  You can cite statistics until the cows come home :)

<CometBaby> Being .. they are NOT a reliable source
<CometBaby> WND picked up that story too .. and I don't consider World Net Daily reliable either
<CometBaby> Not one single reliable source has confirmed that story.
<DAMMiT_> ok, democracy WORKS ... dictatorships don't
<Space2> People of Iraq will be some of the richest people in the Middle East after this
--- Starting response with 'this'

<dubbya> this threat to you, but i know it may be overcome 
<DAMMiT_> capitalism WORKS
<DAMMiT_> yeah really
<CometBaby> dam .. communism fails every time it is tried
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: it does not always work in countries where it didn't start as a grassroots movement...
<DAMMiT_> except in North Korea, right?
<DAMMiT_> levi:  this isnt' a grass roots environment
<DAMMiT_> they have infrastructure
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: it has failed miserably in NK
<DAMMiT_> they have educated people
<DrLee> People of Iraq will be the richest terrorists in New York and SF in the world after this. I agree. ::wink::

<dubbya> by thugs and i think we are not supposed to do you come from new era 
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: They have an ingrained sense of being ruled...you have to breed that out
<DAMMiT_> levi:  exactly, because N. Korea is able to obtain nuclear weapons and programs to create them, they can hijack the entire region, hold it hostage and demand food and other types of aid
<DAMMiT_> levi:  they also have a stock market
<Space2> A democracy only works when you have people with at least a little values and morals, it will be hard to establish in Iraq where torture is respected
--- Starting response with 'respected'
--- Responding: 'he's not that agreement '
<dubbya> he's not that agreement 
<DAMMiT_> so there's obviously some people in there who have a clue
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: so what do YOU propose we do then Einstein?
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: Shoot at them!?
<DAMMiT_> we kill Saddam, rid Iraq of his regime and install a multi-ethnic government in place

<CometBaby> Space2 .. don't write the Iraqi people off so quickly.  It is not the people who love these things .. it is the control that their Religion exercises over them.

<dlevi> but sactions did not work in Iraq, did they? and NK has no reseouces to Sanction!? what is your brilliant plan now!?
--- Starting response with 'now'

<DAMMiT_> know why sanctions didn't work?
<DAMMiT_> because they weren't backed up by anything
<DrLee> You are talking about your democracy as you understand it in Iraq. If Iraqis decide their democracy will be the Islamic law and declare the U.S satan you will not accept their version of democracy. That's the main problem.

<dubbya> problem to showroom, so that is not been coached by a condition for it our country, while inspectors learned that in his libido and all that saddam hussein has chemical agents

<dubbya> it was a caring what i was anyone offer me back in our greatest businessman/politician ever have worked for many parts of waves 
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: they have nothing to Sanction...what is your solution...Same as Iraq, right!? we should just take out the government....
--- Starting response with 'government'

<DAMMiT_> Lee:  then why didn't we put it in there back in 91?
<Space2> Sancations only hurt the people, the leaders will always get what they want and need regardless
<DAMMiT_> we had the chance
<RustyFord> thats not entirely true, democracy works pretty good in Turkey
<CometBaby> DrLee .. all good things come with time.  All we have to do is introduce freedom to Iraq and it will take root.  It is like *trickle down freedom* .. once they get a taste of it, they won't want to go back.
--- Starting response with 'back'

<DrLee> DAMMiT_, 91 was about Kuwait not Iraq.

<dubbya> iraq likely have never wanted kennedy to be using the government-in-exile as before, we don't remember gw1 being prosecuted for instance, that is, how do nothing spectacular has also give us insisted iraq 
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: because we accomplished what we set out to accomplish...it was never about regime change in 91
<DAMMiT_> uhh
<DAMMiT_> dude
<DAMMiT_> it was about Iraq

<dubbya> iraq i'm a future 
<RustyFord> as long as the government stays secular it should be fine
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: don't be daft
<DAMMiT_> heh, i'm not
<DAMMiT_> i'm being (again) realistic
<DrLee> CometBaby, it's like feeding pizza to fish. Or introducing vegetarian food in Somal.
<CometBaby> Dam .. Bush announced our mission and our goal before we ever went in. He said that he wanted to get them out of Kuwait. We were ASKED by Kuwait to go in and help. It was never intended to take the war to ..Baghdad....

--- Starting response with 'gw1'

<DAMMiT_> getting rid of saddam
<TheTailor> CB:  Had we gone on to Baghdad back then it would have created an international diplomatic firestorm.

<dubbya> iraq i'm for, then has a design for a field in october of these steps, the taliban telling people of iraq in its nuclear weapon, and beyond all mankind 
<DAMMiT_> getting RID of saddam
<DrLee> The main problem of the Bush admin is that they don't understand who they are dealing with. They never take the time to understand the other side. They mean good but cause more harm than good.
<DAMMiT_> and making sure each ethnic group has equal say in government - that is democracy ... maybe then they'll stop killing each other
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: this is going to take a bit of occupation...if you are such a realist you would know this
<TheTailor> draco____:  Untrue.
<TheTailor> err..
<RustyFord> how is this causing harm?
<DAMMiT_> i know this will take occupation
<TheTailor> DrLee:  Untrue.
<CometBaby> Dam .. we never said we would get rid of Saddam.  We hoped we would, but it was not one of the intended goals.  So far, we have not been into assassination.
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: they have been killing eachother for centuries...
<RustyFord> i mean yeh the war sux, but how overall is this causing harm ?
<DAMMiT_> to keep remaining bits of Saddam's force from overthrowing the government in place
<DAMMiT_> until the democratic government in place can sustain power effectively
<CometBaby> TT .. absolutely
<DAMMiT_> levi:  well, now its only one person doing the killing, and he needs to be stopped
<DAMMiT_> im sure you'd feel differently if you lived in Iraq
<RustyFord> we have been dealing with Saddam for over 20 years now, I think we know Saddam pretty damn well
<DrLee> RustyFord, 'how' we dont know now, give it ten years. The 91 war caused Bin Laden after 10 years.
<DAMMiT_> but you dont, so what does it matter to you?
<DAMMiT_> ah well
<DAMMiT_> time to get to clas
<RustyFord> the 91 war did what?!?!?!
<DAMMiT_> good talking with you people
<DAMMiT_> later
<RustyFord> that didn't cause bin_laden
<RustyFord> hahahahaha
<Being> it was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan that created bin Laden
<dlevi> DAMMiT_: only one person huh? you believe that? only saddam has killed in the entire country of Iraq? He doesn't have a power structure to help?
--- Starting response with 'help'
--- Responding: 'help an opinion.. oddly enough to enforce UN security council have had materials and join us, we now that threatens us bring to let the shoe fits .. all the foreseeable future, but i really don't give an end the dictator - his nuclear weapons of the edge of children being realistic '

<DrLee> American TAX payer money as well.
<CometBaby> Heard some interesting news on the radio this morning.  It seems here in Omaha a Teacher (unnamed) made some unAmerican comments in the classroom and two students complained.  Thats about all they are reporting ..  don't know what grade level we are talking about, or if it was Univ of Nebr. in Omaha.
<Being> I wonder when the children will start reporting their parents
<CometBaby> It always warms my heart when I hear that this propoganda is acted upon.
<CometBaby> Being .. there are reports coming out today, that the Iraqi army is FORCING children to take up arms .. with the threat of executing their parents if they do not.
<CometBaby> They feel that the coalition forces would not return fire on chldren.
<Being> CometBaby it sounds like the dying days of the third reich
<CometBaby> Being .. great analogy!!!
<Being> a kid with a gun will generally surrender to a man with a gun
<DrLee> Reports about Iraqis eating their babies wouldnt surprise me either. It's war and propaganda is one of the weapons used.
--- Starting response with 'used'

<dubbya> used to let his aggression in nasiriya? 
<CometBaby> Being well said .. (wish I had said it0
<RustyFord> oh gees
<Being> Hitler had child soldiers as well and they did not do much
<RustyFord> hahahah DrLee get real
<RustyFord> many people in middle east promote their kids carrying guns into battle
<RustyFord> i see it on TV just about everyday in Palestine, arabs are not above using ANY means
<DrLee> There's no such things as Palestine.
<Being> I know one who was taken by British soldiers. He wound up owning the gas station in the village outside Oxford that I lived in.
<Being> he was just 13 when they captured him. Both his parents had been killed.
<RustyFord> DrLee not yet anyway
<DrLee> RustyFord, not any time.
<RustyFord> yeh whatever DrLee
<Being> A british family adopted him
<RustyFord> thats why the Palestinians just named a Prime Minister position
<CometBaby> DrLee somewhere this morning I had found a picture of the children with guns.  I tried to find it back, so you could view it and then make your arguement.  Unfortunately I cannot find it back.
<RustyFord> yet another step towards a Palestinian country
<CometBaby> One of the problems with excessive surfing :)
<RustyFord> hahah I hate that Comet

<DrLee> CometBaby, sont have to provide pictures, I believe every word you say.
<DrLee> Say/type*
<CometBaby> DrLee .. thnx :)
<Being> CometBaby I bet if you did a Yahoo search you would find them
<CometBaby> hmm let me try
<Being> I saw one thing a 350-photo slideshow which had better pictures than CNN
<CometBaby> well I put in Children Iraq Army and didn't come up with anything
--- Starting response with 'anything'
--- Responding: 'anything to set out there other words '
<dubbya> anything to set out there other words 
<Being> I have to say the still pictures are SO WAY MUCH BETTER than the TV coverage.
<TimothyWT> The 1991 war did create the Personality inside of Usama bin Ladin cause Saudia Arabia told Bin Ladin that his Mujahadeen was not accepted as a Force inside Saudia Arabia but that was one of the let downs that Saudia Arabia did and that is the second cause of Usama bin Ladin to recreate the Al-Qeada
<Being> by 10000 to 1
<Being> I saw that interview of a guy taken in a nightscope. He looked like an Alien Being with yellow eyes.
<Being> on a videophone at night taken through a nightscope
<Being> totally wierd
<Rebec> being I could see that as strange
<Being> It added a surreal quality to it.
<Quebecker> hey guys, what are you talking about?
<Rebec> no doubt
<Rebec> this interview being saw last night
<Rebec> bec how are you?
<Being> It was not an interview, it was a report from the front, sorry.
<Being> he was staring into the camera with the nightscope and the videophone
<|meteor|> 3Abusive domain or user
<Being> he looked all green with white/yellow eyes
<Quebecker> you'd think he'd take of the nightscope
<Being> it was a light blackout at the position
<Being> he could not do so.
<Quebecker> I love the pictures we're getting from those guys, but I just don't like journalists on the lines with the troops
<Rebec> I agree
<Being> I think the still pictures are way better than the TV coverage.
<Quebecker> well, I love the video if they was no commentary
<Quebecker> if all they said was what they were involved in at the moment would be fine... I don't want some ret. general to give me HIS opinion
<Being> well, CNN is broadcast worldwide, but many local newspapers and TV channels are not. So it is not such a worry for them to produce useful information about the war.
<Quebecker> especially if its from CNN
<Being> CNN also has to demoralize the enemy
<Being> our local newspapers do not.
<Quebecker> I suppose
<Quebecker> I know some of my stations up here are critizing CNN for the way its reporting, citing proproganda
<DrLee> Why would anyone take the time to tell lies to make a point in a chat room. I never question people I chat with and beleive what they say. But we all know that making picture with 'paint shop' is not hard, and anyone with a PC can make videos and put them on the net. People deffend what they read and see including my self.

<Rebec> they are not wanting to be seen as anything but Western
<^rcane> Rebec: that would shut em up for a while
<Rebec> rcane I don't know what he's going to do.  
<Rebec> rcane I haven't called to ask lol
<DrLee> King Abdulah is the model of Arab leader, someone with a british mother who speaks Arabic as second language, someone who says 'yes sir' when asked to speak. They need someone like that in Iraq.
<Rebec> rcane but he will do whatever he feels is necessary I'm sure so if he feels it necessary to do a black march or April or whatever he will
<Rebec> DrLee yes and a friend of mine :)
<Rebec> see bring back the monarchy
<TimothyWT> DrLee : Ahmed Chalabi is the man 
<Being> it will need civilised men such as King Abdullah to establish the Rule of Law in these places.

<Rebec> Being yes I agree
<DPG> tony answering the questions
<^rcane> The only thing I don't like is you need force to establish law there
<DrLee> TimothyWT, you should find out who is Ahmed Chalabi. He is a thief, a banker wanted in Jordan. In fact he step in Jordan he will serve 30 years in prison.
<^rcane> but that is the way of the beast
<Being> they are anarchic societies
<][Hook][> DPG: do you ever have a point? or do you just come in here to troll?
<Being> they need the Iron Rod
<Rebec> rcane well  you need civilized men who can be humane and brutal at the same time
<^rcane> yea
<DPG> hook, depends on how you look at it
<TimothyWT> DrLee : I know who Ahmed Chalabi is
<][Hook][> DPG: not really
<hashbar> civilized men = no such thing
<][Hook][> DPG: having a point doesn't depend on perspective
<Rebec> rcane like King Hussein who was called the humane king but could be a tyrant when needed
<][Hook][> DPG: it depends on actually having a point =]

<dubbya> they dont take sh*t 
<Rebec> hashbar you cynic
<DrLee> King Abdulah is not any better than Saddam when comes to his people, Jordanians hate him. He's 'civilized' because he does what he asked to do by the U.S.
<Rebec> DrLee no he is civilized because he is a civilized person, it has nothing to do with politics
<DrLee> Do a simple searcon google about Jordan human rights.
<Rebec> but whatever everyone can hold their own opinions
<DrLee> search*
<][Hook][> Rebec: apparently some people can't separate politics from "real life"
<Rebec> DrLee I've done the searches I know, and I also know Abdullah personally
<Rebec> Hook yes apparently or real life from their own opinions having never met someone
<DPG> Rebec you know Abdullah personally?
<Rebec> He is for example against honor killings
<Rebec> Yes DPG I do
<TimothyWT> DrLee : Jordan could use that Crime as a Rallying Cry for the Leadership of Ahmed Chalabi to take Power in Iraq to prove that Ahmed Chalabi can reform himself and payback the Jordanians with giving his people a better future...
--- Starting response with 'future'

<dubbya> future we will be townhall meetings 
<][Hook][> my politics would dictate that I never associate with liberals, yet I associate with them all the time because they are also people, and the ones I happen to know are good people... even if I find their views misguided
<DPG> where did you meet him
<Rebec> DPG in Boston at a conference, it's rather a long story
<DrLee> Rebec, if you know Abdulah please tell him 'Kuss umm Arabs kifak' for mr please.
<DPG> Rebec, have you been in his palace
<Rebec> DrLee I would never tell him that. I'm not a fool
<Rebec> DPG No, I was invited but I have never gone
<^rcane> DrLee: that isn't very nice
<Rebec> rcane which is why I'd never say it. I mean he'd take it from me but he'd think I was strange
<DrLee> ^rcane, not nice but the truth. Everyone of his own people can tell you that about him.
<Rebec> DPG I haven't gone cause the middle east is such a volatile region I've never wanted to really go over there
<][Hook][> DrLee: tell your self "Kuss ummak" =]
<DPG> rebec, jordan is fine
<Rebec> DPG I know
<TimothyWT> DrLee : Jordan could use that Crime as a Rallying Cry for the Leadership of Ahmed Chalabi to take Power in Iraq to prove that Ahmed Chalabi can reform himself and payback the Jordanians with giving the people of Iraq a better future thus giving the Jordanians something to work on

<][Hook][> sharmute
<Rebec> DrLee democracy isn't always a good thing
<DrLee> TimothyWT, this is really not the ideal time nor the place to talk about Chalabi. 
<][Hook][> why is it that the only arabic terms I remember are the curses?
<TimothyWT> DrLee : why
<TimothyWT> DrLee : you hate him I bet...
<Rebec> Hook cause they're the most fun. I remember when Abdullah taught me to swear in Arabic, I don't remember all the words anymore but it was fun
<DrLee> Rebec, if it's good for Iraqis it's good for Jordanians who the U.S give millions of dollars as aids and go to Abdulah pockets not the people.
--- Starting response with 'people'

<TimothyWT> DrLee : he is no Criminal.......
<Rebec> Bec no but Blair impresses me more these days
<DrLee> Rebec, can he prove it's going to the people? Read about Jordan human rights, talk to Jordanians and come back we'll chat about it some more.
<][Hook][> Blair is a better politician
<][Hook][> more polished
<RustyFord> Iraqi TV, The state-run television warned residents Wednesday that American troops were prepared to use chemical weapons in Iraq as part of their ''colonization of the Muslim world,'' residents said.

<^rcane> DrLee: it is when they get crazy like the 70s that they must be taken care of
<DrLee> Blair answers questions every single day, he deserve respect.
<Rebec> and women are better off now than they have been in a long time in Jordan
<Rebec> so prove to me it doesn't go to the people
<Rebec> it's not like Abdullah randomly rapes women like Saddam
<Rebec> he's a civilized man

<Being> The government of France contends that Britain and the United States will be unable to play a credible role in the reconstruction of post-war Iraq.

They will call it Sh'Iraq.

<Dirk_IIV> it wasn't suicide
<Airbuster> and I'm sure after this they'll try to make us think they've buried the hatchet. Not so. They'll try and find some other way to screw us up
<panini> the french are a rude, disgusting people
<^rcane> who is johnny knoxville?

<Dirk_IIV> jackass was the hiighest rated show on mtv
<Sky_High_> I liked it, its just that the stars prob got tired of it, and where moving on to better things.

<phaed> I thought they had the highest rated MTV show of all time.
<Sky_High_> I think it is.
<Dirk_IIV> the osbournes was the highest
<Dirk_IIV> Jackass was 2nd
<^rcane> phaed: hell if I know... I don't watch mtv, I am not black
<Sky_High_> Jackass can be really weak though, sometimes.
<phaed> riight
<Sky_High_> Some of the toilet "humor" sucks.
<RustyFord> The House passed a resolution Thursday calling for a national day of humility, prayer and fasting in a time of war and terrorism.
<panini> mtv is only for black people?

<pilgrim`> panini iirc the Baha'i fast period just ended
<phaed> Chindogg:  Fox News is always long on opinion and short on content.  I haven't watched them once since the start of the war.

<Airbuster> yeah phaed, you just don't agree with those opinions
<Chindogg> thats why fox news is on top of the war ratings
<Airbuster> CNN has just as much opinion as FNC
<Airbuster> it's just they're different opinions
<Sting9Wrk> their opinions just suck
<][Hook][> Pickle: then she has the gaul to say "Bush should have taken care of them back in the Gulf War"  knowing full well that Democrats back then were chanting the 'UN mandate' mantra
<][Hook][> err
<][Hook][> gall too
<Airbuster> FNC is more logical and reasonable
<DoYouKnow> hi
<phaed> Airbuster:  No, I just want to know the facts of what's going on the middle east.  Fox News has hardly any reporters in the field.  They have to take stories from Sky News to have any substance.
<Chindogg> CNN's opinions do suck
<Pickle> Hook, and she was probably chanting it along with them.
<phaed> Airbuster:  All they've ever had is the primetime lineup of pundits.  They aren't much of a news organization.

<phaed> Yep, they do.
<DoYouKnow> they usually ask the questions in english (without a mic) then they are translated to arabic and answered in arabic
<Dirk_IIV> Chindogg: perhaps u do
<Pickle> Hook, she's passionate about not thinking.
<Duffster> Why did Connie Wang Chung get shit-canned?

<panini> like all liberals, she doesn
<][Hook][> he should tell her that if she wants her own talk show, she should go get an internship
<panini> er
<Chindogg> (Dirk_IIV): does it matter? vocabulary is just a way to sound samrter than you actually are
<panini> like all liberals, she doesn't believe in free speech
<Dirk_IIV> Chindogg: u brought up vocab
<][Hook][> if there's one thing I can say about Rush, it's that he isn't "rude"

<beeper> once allah goes the way of zeus and marduk we'll win
<][Hook][> phaed: we have to think about reconstruction before we even win

<Dirk_IIV> god means a lot to the impoverished muslim masses
<Dirk_IIV> what else do they have?

<][Hook][> phaed: you're putting the cart before the horse
<DrLee> They have oil and Allah, take their oil and you'll get all the Allah they have.
<CometBaby> phaed ..let me get this straight.  If we plan to win, then we are not making a real effort to lose the battle against terrorism?  Or we are not willing to comprimise about WMD inspections in Iraq and pretend Saddam was complying?  Or 12 years was not long enough to conduct inspections?
--- Starting response with 'inspections'
--- Responding: 'inspections program to sleep total this nation moves troops and starvation '
<dubbya> inspections program to sleep total this nation moves troops and starvation 
<DoYouKnow> that's true Blackt. But there is another real possibility... maybe people are just going to give up and say.. Yah, I'm tired of all the left-wing bullshit you're spewing in the channel, I'm going to hunt you down and shoot the hell out of you with my automatic rifle
<FreeTrade> DYK, Until it became apparent that for political reasons saddam needed islam he was an atheist, I suspect he still is.

<phaed> CometBaby:  LOL.  Quote me on that.
<FreeTrade> This battle will turn at some point and it will turn dramatically
<Dirk_IIV> Qatar is kind of different
<CometBaby> so the assumption is .. we should have planned to lose?
<FreeTrade> Like a house of cards.

<FreeTrade> I understand Anti war, I dont understand Anti American.
<DoYouKnow> Chindogg: maybe, it might take longer
<DoYouKnow> Chindogg: it should take less than 6 weeks

<DoYouKnow> Chindogg: they are expecting 5,000 american casualities, we haven't seen a glimpse of the true war yet 
<FreeTrade> I protested against the Vietnam war many years ago, but I always supported the troops, and hoped they won every battle.
<CometBaby> last week one of them threw acid on a policeman .. fortunately he had a shield in front of him

<panini> Blackt vandalism, defecation, etc
<CometBaby> Blackt .. you asked me a question and I answered it.  You ignored my answer.  How rude.
<][Hook][> DoYouKnow: France opposed our efforts as well

<DoYouKnow> first of all, jordan just wants iraq's oil... they're nearly the same country, except they haven't raised enough eyebrows to cut western web designers from access to their site
<dlevi> Cometbaby: the protests in SF have gotten completely out of control...I think more to a point of mob mentality than anti-war. There are still peaceful protests happenning around the country.

<pilgrim`> Portland too,  all around the Morrison and Steel bridges

<pilgrim`> Hackworth has that article quite right
<FreeTrade> Twice wrong maybe he has learned.
<FreeTrade> See the problem is they apply ww2 thinking to the modern military. no comparison

<FreeTrade> This is so human nature.
<pilgrim`> most decorated serviceman in history.  
<pilgrim`> he does not have the CMH but he has damn near every other one
<FreeTrade> You get locked into a mindset and your thinking is in a box and you lose the ability to look beyond and look down upon the new exigencies of war.
<CometBaby> GOP ..I have talked to Hack on the phone .. I met him through my mentor who was a friend of his from WWII.  My mentor was a Colonel in the Army.

<Duffster> CometBaby, you dont like hackworth?  i like him, he's very objective, i think...
<FreeTrade> Hackworth would still be carrying a non ergonomic pack with a M1 Carbine which weighs 90 pounds.
<pilgrim`> he went into exile down under
<FreeTrade> Comet, Hackworth left America ?
<CometBaby> he lived in Austrailia for about nine years .. he had a mistress and a son there.
<gop> FreeTrade: hackworth is a true solider
<CometBaby> FreeTrade yes
<FreeTrade> Shit I didnt know that.
<Fazzer> MTV have banned showings of videos with war-like content... such as Aerosmith - Don't wanna lose a thing, billy idol, B-52 songs, etc... that's just plain and simple nonsense
<Dork-IV> ARE U THINKING ABOOUT MACARTHUR?
<Fazzer> now. Not that they would show those videos anyway
<CometBaby> FreeTrade I found that out from my mentor
<CometBaby> I didn't know it either
<Dork-IV> whups
<Duffster> hackworth, from the way i read him, is very libertarian...
<gop> Fazzer: they should ban antiwar teen who speak out on that station
<FreeTrade> Comet you can also just tell in his voice like Dick Morris who is entertaining hes a bit nuts.
<pilgrim`> he speaks about it, and about the interview that did him in.  His bio "About Face"
<gop> the fcc should baned mtv for being antiwar

<Fazzer> epix|work: They don't want viewers to turn away from the channel if they feel offended. it's about money as usual
<pilgrim`> Comet he saw his troops turned into fertilizer and then politiocs order them to give back the hills they bled for one too many times
<FreeTrade> Hackworth is an anachronism like so many, the military today is the best we have ever had in US history.
<FreeTrade> They are professional soldiers, best trained, best equipped
<pilgrim`> his descriptions of Korea... they jive with what an uncle of mine told me
<Duffster> CometBaby, well, what person WASNT against the Vietnam War...?  50-60K DEAD?  FOR WHAT?!#?

<pilgrim`> Hack mentions a end run type tactic in that article, and, I agree.  if we can cut off the head completely, the rest of the army fades to nothing
<FreeTrade> BlackT, Not at all
<pilgrim`> the key here is completely
<FreeTrade> Im quoting what I have said all along.
<FreeTrade> I have my own mind. And 90% of the time Im right.

<Fazzer> they are not ready for democracy
<gop> Kuwait seem to accept us
<Fazzer> Kuwait wasn't ruled by a dictator
<FreeTrade> Historically arabs have been occupied many times and they accepted it, but the difference is this time we will help them reconstruct their own government which is more representative of the different groups in Iraq.

<gop> FreeTrade: your right this time muslim will had aid from the usa so they won't need much money to reconstruct as in previous times when they had a long battle ahead
<Fazzer> their own + religios interest will be more important 
<CometBaby> Fazzer .. the people of Iraq have lived under a terrorist dictator for a long time .. in addition, their religion was USED to control them and to justify evil deeds.  Freedom will do it's work however .. slowly they will learn to embrace it.

<CometBaby> I have to admit . . people who are not used to freedom have a difficult time thinking for themselves .. but they learn. It is going to take time.  I think of it as "trickle down freedom".
<CometBaby> FreeTrade .. right
<FreeTrade> I told comet in private message and I mentioned it on channel

<gop> CometBaby: may be is a special op mission and no war hence since they already have weapons of mass destruction

<][Hook][> Blackt: Why can't you sit back and wait to see how things turn out before you pass judgement on the whole action?
<Fazzer> geneva rules are a joke
<Blackt> Hook, I thought you were suggesting that being emotional was against the war effort and should be quelled.
<Fazzer> they only work in time of peace
<gop> Fazzer: yes there alot you can do and is just by exposing them so liberal see it not about oil and after the war is over we could call for war crimes in genva
<][Hook][> Blackt: no... I'm saying that many of the anti-war protesters are fueled by emotion

<gop> Anti-war groups had called for a day of widespread civil disobedience, including blocking busy intersections and staging a "die-in" to protest media and corporate "profiteering from the war.
<Blackt> What kind of mentality do you need to be someone who want to just debase other humans?

<Traytor> Some of these protestors ARE violent.
<][Hook][> Blackt: I wish no harm whatsoever on people who really want their voice to be heard.  I cannot speak for anyone else.

<Blackt> Hook, it's propaganda, to support the war effort, the media must minimize the protestors.. I understand this.

<Mootar> heh
<DoYouKnow> Blackt: I don't think anyone was killed
<Mootar> darn
<DoYouKnow> what harm is there in laughing at a sole tv station in a tiny country being bombed by the largest country in the world with thousands of stations?
--- Starting response with 'stations'
--- Responding: 'stations up 30,000 munitions '
<dubbya> stations up 30,000 munitions 
<dlevi> mootar: now why would the iraqi's break the rules? Answer: because they *know* its the *only* chance in *hell* they could *ever* win!?
<Mootar> why don't we bomb Iraqi tv when like... the defense minister is sitting there with his rifle railing against america?
--- Starting response with 'america'
--- Responding: 'america a couple of the remains the senator has defied security '
<dubbya> america a couple of the remains the senator has defied security 
<Mootar> dlevi:  I agree... except I might have a problem with the word "win"
<Fazzer> Mootar: TV transmitters sitting on mosques....

<skezz> <period>
<Mootar> skezz:  define victory for me please
<dlevi> mootar: they won't win...but...they haven't figured that out yet
<DrLee> Blackt, what can you do but laugh at bombing a 3rd world country that has been under sanction, a 3rd world country with 2/3 of it's territory under no fly zone rule. I can only laugh at 8 days and $75 billion for a war with a Dictator no one supposedly likes in his own country.
--- Starting response with 'country'
--- Responding: 'country and then that protects terrorists, or user '
<dubbya> country and then that protects terrorists, or user 
<DrLee> Let me laugh for a second. HAHA
<skezz> Mootar:  Saddam and his regime staying in power
<CometBaby> I'm confused .. I heard that they used the EBomb the other day to take out the TV Station .. now Fox is saying that the EBomb has not been used yet.

<dubbya> yet this country. they do so the french built a taste of the world of iraq 
<skezz> Mootar:  With an ending cease fire as the last war
<Mootar> military victory?  victory in post military iraq?  victory in turning the arab street even more anti-US?  victory in killing hundreds of coalition soldiers?
--- Starting response with 'soldiers'
--- Responding: 'soldiers who are such as dr lee '
<dubbya> soldiers who are such as dr lee 
<Mootar> ah
<Mootar> ok, then I agree
<skezz> ok I can see you're just a troll, so forget I said anything
<dlevi> iow: they don't know what the hell is going on
<Mootar> but, as for winning other, less tangible, victorys... I think Iraq has a chance
--- Starting response with 'chance'
--- Responding: 'chance in awe that we americans receive the law" statement has given a multi-ethnic government must end to work '
<dubbya> chance in awe that we americans receive the law" statement has given a multi-ethnic government must end to work 
<DoYouKnow> CometBaby: well, someone told me yesterday that they were to use 4 ebombs tonight, maybe they meant this night instead of last night
<CometBaby> Well they have dropped more Rangers in . .  to cut off any escape to the north
<Mootar> I'm a troll because I asked you to define a term... hrm, I'll have to tell my polisci mresearch professors that
<Traytor> mootar, blackt, and dlevi.
<CometBaby> DoYouKnow .. hmm interesting
<|meteor|> 3P0rn bot
<Traytor> fucking leftists.
<Blackt> nice nick Traytor.. fits you well you hate your own countrymen
<dlevi> Traytor: thanks...i think...
<DoYouKnow> CometBaby: it's just something I overheard in a channel, it might not be accurate
<Traytor> haha
<Mootar> you deny that Iraq's proganda is influencing the Arab countrie's citizens more than the US reports?
<dlevi> traytor: and your beef with me is <hmm?>
<Traytor> blackt: I hate nobody.
<Fazzer> Have you seen how green and "nice" the kurdish areas of iraq are. no desert there...
--- Starting response with 'there'
--- Responding: 'there is not act like '
<dubbya> there is not act like 
<CometBaby> DoYouKnow, ok
<Mootar> the military has been very secretive about their ebombs... I wonder why
--- Starting response with 'why'
--- Responding: 'why hes a dying days '
<dubbya> why hes a dying days 
<DrLee> A war with a 3rd world country under 12 years of sanction and 2/3 of it's terroritory under no fly zone, with U.N inspectors in and out for 12 years shouldnot take 8 days and $75 billion for the first 30 days.
--- Starting response with 'days'
--- Responding: 'days of such weapons '
<dubbya> days of such weapons 
<skezz> The military is secretive about a lot of things
<Mootar> they seem likethe sort of munition we would want to advertise tho
<skezz> every move the military makes is not for the public to know
<DoYouKnow> Mootar: not really
<skezz> nor should it be
<Mootar> pretty nonlethal
<Dirk_IIV> it's TOP SECRET
<DoYouKnow> Mootar: well, there are different ways to generate an electromagnetic pulse
<Fazzer> ebomb might work against other objectives when u want to do phone tapping etc
--- Starting response with 'etc'
--- Responding: 'etc are not know that a sad is it wouldnt back the inspectors believe every camp *shrug* '
<dubbya> etc are not know that a sad is it wouldnt back the inspectors believe every camp *shrug* 
<Mootar> skezz:  yeah, but we send back reports about squashing a column of republican guards... 
<skezz> You need to really stop expecting the military should throw up everything they do to the media
<dlevi> dork
<CometBaby> Mootar .. because there are such things as military secrets?  Could that be it?
<Mootar> CometBaby:  but why keep this one secret?
<CometBaby> Mootar .. why not?
<skezz> Mootar:  You don't seem to understand the military is not for the entire public, for obvious reasons
<][Hook][> Blackt: the media doesn't cover the loonies for propaganda... they do it for ratings
<CometBaby> They have no obligation not to.
<Mootar> I think I'd rather keep the paratrooper drop secret
<skezz> So I doubt there is really any getting through to you
<DoYouKnow> the way which utilizes the transfer of kinetic energy to change the electromagnetic potential locked in a capacitor or coil to an Electromagnetic force in a short period of time is what they're expected to be using
<CometBaby> Mootar .. I place my ..judgment in them. They know what they are doing.
<skezz> Mootar:  Enjoy the media coverage you _are_ getting, and stop bitching about what you _are not_
<skezz> mmmk?
<][Hook][> Blackt: the media isn't "for" this war because of it's politics... it embraces the coverage for the ratings
<Dirk_IIV> well go figure
<Mootar> since when was I bitching?
<Fazzer> they didn't even have to parashute in. they could have landed... the CIA+kurdish army prepared airfields over the last weeks... it's all propaganda
<Fazzer> or alot
<Blackt> Hook, I disagree, they media is focused on getting that $$ support from the public via propaganda for continuing BUSH's war effort.
--- Starting response with 'effort'
--- Responding: 'effort to consider the most important '
<dubbya> effort to consider the most important 
<CometBaby> Personally, I think it is a very humane thing to let them know that their escape route to the north is going to be history.
<DoYouKnow> this is also known as a flux compression generator... I read a paper recently about how this can be achieved by channeling an explosion into a dielectric in such a way that compresses the dielectric as the explosion moves outward
<skezz> Fazzer:  Franks wouldn't fly in troops, if he did not need to
<Fazzer> it's a demonstration of power. the world media took the bait, and swallowed it
<skezz> Fazzer:  Exspecially with the risk of life loss
<skezz> all these generals in here today
<skezz> heh
<Fazzer> Franks and beans
<CometBaby> The Iraqi soldiers are being given a lot of warnings .. surrender or die.  I don't object to that.
<skezz> they can all "do it better" and "know the better way"
<skezz> and what "Everything means"
<Mootar> Comet:  they're also being given the warning of "surrender and die"
<skezz> without ever even being enlisted
<skezz> interesting ...
<][Hook][> Mootar: I'll define victory for you: our present campaign is directed at removing Hussein from the Iraqi power structure, and finding and destroying any weapons currently proscribed by the UN.  If we achieve both of these goals it will be considered a "victory"
--- Starting response with '"victory"'
--- Responding: 'but it's some woman who support and confound the hiighest rated higher than the people '
<dubbya> but it's some woman who support and confound the hiighest rated higher than the people 
<CometBaby> Mootar yes, that's what I said
<Mootar> ah, but that isn't the extent of our campaign
<skezz> I never knew commanding skills of an army came as a natural to some pplz
<skezz> it's very interesting indeed
<Mootar> no, you said surrender or die, I said surrender AND die :}
<][Hook][> Mootar: that is our stated goals... we have pronounced secondary wishes, but they aren't really "goals"
<CometBaby> the warning is surrender OR die.  The only one that will kill them if they surrender is Saddam.
<skezz> We have a way to recognize Iraqi troops dressed in US uniforms now
--- Starting response with 'now'
--- Responding: 'now aljazeera's websites have possessed a specific federal screeners in cold or a time shit? '
<dubbya> now aljazeera's websites have possessed a specific federal screeners in cold or a time shit? 
<][Hook][> Mootar: If Hussein is removed from the country, the people will be much better off.  This cannot possibly be denied.
<skezz> something to do with Chem Pants
<Mootar> I didn't say WE were saying surrender and die... but if I was an Iraqi soldier, and the Americans were 50 miles away, whereas a Saddam henchmen was 5 feet away, I do believe I'd have a rifle in my hands ready to fight
--- Starting response with 'fight'
--- Responding: 'fight a "die-in" there that mural there needs to address the world '
<dubbya> fight a "die-in" there that mural there needs to address the world 
<Mootar> Hook:  and I wouldn't deny that
<DrLee> 'Surrender or die, who gives sh*t, just be there for the cameras when we will give your kids cookies and milk" And don't forget to smile for cameras while dead the viewers like smiles.
<skezz> Mootar:   Why ask for a "surrender" .. how about just "die"
<skezz> (;
<skezz> Mootar:   They don't mind executing our POWs
<][Hook][> Mootar: It is an unfortunate fact that many of Iraqis will fight us and die who do not wish to
--- Starting response with 'to'

<dubbya> to do you talking and security and aggression 
<skezz> why should we care who we kill?
<skezz> (;
<skezz> we shouldnt =D
<DoYouKnow> you could take a bigass capacitor that holds maybe 250,000 volts, then put it in a pipe bomb and detonate it a couple feet from a tv, that would definitely destroy the TV
--- Starting response with 'tv'
--- Responding: 'tv show them do whatever he survived thanks for it... '
<dubbya> tv show them do whatever he survived thanks for it... 
<skezz> I say, mow down whatever you have to, to get to Baghdad 
<DoYouKnow> though I'm not sure it would be from the electromagnetic pulse

<Fazzer> I want to see a nuclear war before I die. 
<Mootar> skezz:  and elicit even more hatred from the arab street :/  I like how the campaign is going now
<Mootar> Fazzer:  ufortunatly, you wouldmprobably see it RIGHT before you die :/
<skezz> Mootar:  I don't care about the "arab street"
<][Hook][> Mootar: We do not need to lift a finger to elicit hatred from the arab street.
<skezz> mmmk?
<DoYouKnow> haha
<Fazzer> skezz: But then I would die with a smile on my lips!
<skezz> Mootar:   The arab street can rot in the street (imo)
<skezz> they don't care about me .. why should I about them?
<skezz> eh?
<Fazzer> imagine getting a BJ and watching a Nuke go off in the horizon
<][Hook][> Mootar: The arabs in power want to stay in power... that is why they constantly demonize the US as the cause of all muslim trouble and sorrow
<Mootar> skezz:  but they don't... they rott in our twin towers, in our USS Coal, in our Military bases
<skezz> Mootar:   We have plenty of control over what people can do
<skezz> Mootar:  Have you noticed another 911 yet?
<skezz> no, you havn't have you
<skezz> stop cowering in the corner, and grow some "testi"
<Dirk_IIV> hoow many pushups can yoou do?
<Mootar> *note to self* killing civilizians indescriminetly makes me a man
<dlevi> man...i like this skezz guy
<CometBaby> fazeer .. such trolling does not pass for debate
<skezz> I don't cower in a corner, b.c of what might happen
<CometBaby> 3$$1 go sit in the corner with this dirty gym sock in your mouth and think about this.
<skezz> I do my normal life

<dubbya> to make sure you'd think weve even within my country, the greatest businessman/politician ever devised 
<][Hook][> Mootar: what would you have our troops do?
<Mootar> Hook:  I didn't say we had to do anything to elicit hate, I said we can do things to suppress that hate ... even if just a little
<Mootar> Hook:  indeed 'tis
<skezz> no
<skezz> Mootar:  You mean appease
<skezz> Mootar:  which is sickining
<Mootar> that's slightly above my paygrade
<Mootar> appeasement and slaughter are two totally different things
<skezz> Mootar:   You don't appease your enemies with love 
<][Hook][> Mootar: we are not responsible for what others feel about us... or why they feel it
<Mootar> we aren't?
<skezz> Mootar:   you destroy them
<][Hook][> Mootar: Arabs are fed hatred for America for breakfast by regimes such as Hussein's
<skezz> Mootar:   You don't appease those who wish to kill you, in order to stay alive, you secure your future, by fighting against them and killing the lot of them
<Mootar> skezz:  so... who is next then?  Libya?  Syria?  Egypt?  Nother Korea?  France?
<skezz> Mootar:  Whoever it takes bro
<][Hook][> Mootar: It's a great diversion from the real source of trouble for the average arab citizen
<skezz> whoever it takes
<Blackt> Looks to me like skezz is feeding hatred to Americans.
<skezz> Blackt:  Not really, any American can think how they want to, this is my opinion
<Mootar> Blackt:  I'm starting to feel pretty crumby about them ;}
<skezz> if you don't like it, too bad -D
<Vinner_7> ][Hook][; the SAME fucking thing as YOUR fucking government serves YOU for breakfast.  AXES OF EVIL, HAW HAW HAW
<dlevi> yeah....skezz started to lose me a few lines back...he should have stopped at they hate us...so why care about them 
<skezz> Blackt:   I am an American, im proud of this country, and I dont cower in fear b.c of what someone wishes to do to me b.c I am American
<][Hook][> Vinner_7: I've had the privelage of a few things the average arab living in the dirt has not
<skezz> I do what needs to be done
<][Hook][> Vinner_7: education... freedom of thought and speech
<skezz> You destory your enemies, you do NOT appease them and hope for mercy
<Mootar> skezz:  so I assume you're in the military right?
<skezz> that is a cowards way, and the reason why Saddam had 45 years in power
<skezz> Mootar:  in October =D
<skezz> Mootar:  So you have to be in the military, and on the front lines, in order to be a patriot?
<Mootar> you'll surely be missed :}
<Mootar> no
<Blackt> skezz are you too young to join the service and act on your beliefs in this war effort? (that I'm against)
<skezz> Mootar:  Spare me you're useless leftist babble
<Mootar> but if you're willing to dedicate US troops to mass-slaughter...
<skezz> HAhah
<skezz> we've had 20 die, to what 35,000 some
<][Hook][> Mootar: wait till the war is over before you call it a mass slaughter, eh?
<skezz> give me a break 
<Dirk_IIV> not neccessarily
<Dirk_IIV> college straigh through is perhaps better
<Mootar> Hook:  quit putting words in my mouth!@#!
<skezz> Mootar:  You havn't a clue, you only wish this country to hide behind fear in order to stay afloat
<][Hook][> ==> <Mootar> but if you're willing to dedicate US troops to mass-slaughter...
<][Hook][> err
<dlevi> mootar: in their defense...we have no evidence of mass-slaughter...none
<][Hook][> am I THAT powerful!!? =]
<][Hook][> woohoo!
<skezz> lol
<Mootar> ok, it was hypothetical
<DrLee> Pssst, it's called 'Iraqi Freedom' remember?
<Mootar> I;ll run down the conversation for those who missed it (dlevi and Hook)
<dlevi> mootar: can I just scroll up
<skezz> Mootar is the kind of person that would rather pat Bin ladin on the back, and say:  "bad terrorist, now, what do you want us to do .. so you dont attack us again?"

<Mootar> Skezz basically said the only alternative to appeasement is annihilation
<Mootar> I asked if he was in the military
<skezz> hardly
<Mootar> he said, in october
<dlevi> yeah...maybe the coast guard
<skezz> Mootar:  Do you realize how intact Baghdad is?
<][Hook][> dammit... appeasement and annihilation are both EXTREMES
<skezz> Mootar:  Do you realize how falt it could be?
<Mootar> ah, but what you were proposing is NOT to leave an Iraqi standing
<skezz> flat*
<Dirk_IIV> I WILL BURN HIS ARMS!
<skezz> if we wanted to cream Iraq, we could do so
<skezz> easily
<dlevi> kind of like left and right...but it doesn't stop half the people in here from screaming "commie" whenever you oppose the war
<skezz> we are preserving Iraqis (innoncents) as much as possible
<skezz> we are hardly detroying all of Iraq, or anywhere close
<Mootar> skezz:  and you agree with this policy, correct?
<skezz> in fact, men of ours, and the UK are dying
<skezz> b.c of our slow efforts
<skezz> to preserve Iraqi life
--- Starting response with 'life'
--- Responding: 'life is that is a nuclear scientists, a president '
<dubbya> life is that is a nuclear scientists, a president 
<skezz> so don't come at me with that argument, it is flawed
<skezz> The US fights wars like noone else ever has, which is with the upmost reguard for human life minus mistakes and typical randomness of war
<skezz> we do not slaughter, we do leave wakes of destruction in our path
<Mootar> do you agree with the way we're waging this war?
<Mootar> heh, someone missed WWII :}
<Dirk_IIV> Mootar: yessir
<skezz> I trust Franks knows what he is doing
<Susan`> this isnt ww2
<skezz> Mootar:  Please don't give me that past judgement crap
<RustyFord> WASHINGTON - Hackers on Thursday replaced the English-language Web site for Arab satellite television network Al-Jazeera with a U.S. flag and the message "Let Freedom Ring." Hours later, the site was hacked again by others.

<Mootar> skezz:  you gave me the nomothetic "the US fights wars"
<][Hook][> Mootar: I do not agree with the way we are fighting this war, not completely
<RustyFord> hahahah
<skezz> yes, I am talking about the present
<Susan`> heh rusty
<skezz> WW II was a different situation, with different weapons
<skezz> and a different enemy
<Susan`> it was the dark ages
<Susan`> it doesnt have to be that way anymore
<Susan`> its more tactical 
<Mootar> despite what Rummy says... the Pacific campaign and this war are remarkably similiar
<skezz> omg
<DoYouKnow> RustyFord: well, they probably left the site unsecured... I'm surprised that hackers would target an open news organization like that

<DrLee> I hate to talk this way but let me speel this out for you since you are so happy Iraqis die by the 1000s. Your super power went to war based on a WMD that had/has/will have no ground. We have not seen any WMD and I doubt will unless they shipped them via UPS to Iraq. It's taking you 8 days and $75 billion to roam in the Iraqi desert claiming you are winning a war with a 3rd world country that has been under sanctions for 12 years and 2/3 of it'

<dubbya> why sanctions didn't do. sybil. 
<hashbar> banned missiles isnt WMD

<Duffsterr> DrLee, all that has to happen is have Saddam Hussein unconditionally surrender, then no 1 else gets killed   :)
<DoYouKnow> *no

<skezz> dlevi:  Don't you usually always eventually get kicked from here for trolling?
<dlevi> I don't see many politicians out there admitting they were ever wrong...so don't be daft
<hashbar> its not that im never wrong its that im always right
<][Hook][> dlevi: you misunderstand me
<skezz> dlevi:  Im sure you'll be out the door soon enough, when you start ranting off again
<skezz> [=
<][Hook][> dlevi: I hope there are no WMD
<dlevi> skezz: no...i have been kicked once for calling pickle a name (bad idea) 
<][Hook][> dlevi: and if there are, I hope Hussein has the sense not to make matters worse by unleashing them
<dlevi> skezz: you have been doing nothing but ranting for fifteen minutes
<Mootar> calling someone a pickle in Italy is an insult... 
<Dirk_IIV> skezz is on  for wuite a while
<][Hook][> dlevi is a stand up guy, no matter how misguided I find his opinions =]
<dlevi> no "Pickle"

<Mootar> dlevi:  I know :}
<Blackt> on?
<dlevi> blah
<skezz> heh
<Blackt> are you assigning people to be "on"
<Dirk_IIV> no diss intended
<skezz> I usually ignore left wing idiocy
<skezz> I guess im bored today =D
<Mootar> lucky us
<dlevi> skezz: you keep making this a liberals/conervatives issue...I am quite sure that 76% of the current US population does not fall under the conservative umbrella...There are liberals who support this war
<skezz> hahaha
<skezz> oh my
<][Hook][> no offense skezz... but you are just as bad as Daschle
<Blackt> Will the asignees please raise their hands?
<][Hook][> use specifics more, blanket statements less
<dlevi> ][Hook][: Thanks
<Dirk_IIV> well good for them

<RustyFord> cause he is a ferkin' wetahd!
<skezz> dlevi:  So the anti-war protests are all conservatives?
<skezz> dlevi:  It's the conservative party in the UK that bashed Blair for going into this?
<RustyFord> the conservative labor party;)
<skezz> dlevi:  It's conservatives who are writing books, making claims Bush is the bigger evil?

<dubbya> evil regime defies us trying to sleep last year, i thought mines suck......dropping food on whoever you people and killing civilizians indescriminetly makes is where it again because of them ? 
<dlevi> skezz: to insult on liberals on that base is to ignore some good people who support your position
<dlevi> all
<skezz> dlevi:  You must live in a different world as me
<skezz> dlevi:  Look what "Liberalism" is based on, look at what "Liberalism" decides in the courts
<][Hook][> dlevi: it's the mistake that we are witnessing globally from both sides
<][Hook][> dlevi: US vs THEM
<skezz> surely you don't believe "Liberalism" is the prime solution to this countries problems?
<|meteor|> 3Abusive domain or user
<skezz> surely you do not believe the country slants it's furthest to the "left"?
<panini> skezz solution?? it's the PROBLEM
<RustyFord> maybe Blair will switch parties
<skezz> dlevi:  Do you really think that the majority of this country falls under supporting Liberal politics?
<][Hook][> skezz: the majority of this country doesn't give a flying fuck about politics
<skezz> dlevi:  Or mabey you do, and just want to use that "selected, not elected" slogan about Bush?

<dubbya> bush was a point? or was irrelevant, and have oil and that is the best tech of his son there. 
<][Hook][> skezz: the majority of the WORLD doesn't give a flying fuck about politics
<skezz> ][Hook][:  Thats untrue, and if it at somehow was, it would be sad
<RustyFord> maybe Blair will become president of Iraq
--- Starting response with 'iraq'
--- Responding: 'iraq employs capable of mass-slaughter...none '
<dubbya> iraq employs capable of mass-slaughter...none 
<skezz> ][Hook][:  Politics plays in everything from State government, to economic interests
<RustyFord> hmmm, maybe Blair will find out he was really born in the USA and run for president here
<][Hook][> skezz: you need to learn to separate politics from personal life... and daily life
<RustyFord> him and Clinton were switched at birth?
<Pickle> I think that Blair will wind up doing a Winston Churchill and become a Tory after this.
<RustyFord> er something.... we could make something up
<][Hook][> skezz:  if you allow your own politics to taint everything you do, that's sad
<skezz> ][Hook][:  politics is a part of life
<skezz> ][Hook][:  It sounds like you need to do some growing up, which might be sad in itself
<Blackt> only if you're paid for it.. skezz.. how much longer will you be "on"?
<skezz> i don't know, really doesnt bother me either way
<][Hook][> skezz: I can tell it doesn't bother you... by the way you keep talking about it =]
<[Slasher]> http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/030327/168/3n2sv.html
<skezz> Blackt:  As I said before, politics is a part of life, its a part of economic development, growth, its a part of state government, its a part of expression, freedom
<skezz> its life
<skezz> To say that, politics isn't part of life, then why vote?
<skezz> why bother to watch the news, if it doesnt matter?
<dlevi> jusy got back...skezz- I never said...at any point that the majority of this country supports liberal policy...but I did say that the 76% does not fall strictly under conservative
<skezz> did you know, Turkey politics may end up costing Coalition lives
<][Hook][> skezz: I didn't say politics doesn't have its place... I said it doesn't belong in everything
<skezz> do you think its not part of their life?
<][Hook][> skezz: you can't go around painting everything and everyone with your own little political brush
<][Hook][> skezz: well of course you *can* ... but why would you want to?
<skezz> ][Hook][:  It belongs in this room, hence why the room name is #politics
<skezz> (duh)
<skezz> if you don't like hearing of politics by me here, then I suggest you try another room
<skezz> and or /ignore me =D
<dlevi> skezz: ][hook][: time to go...I would like to carry this on later...round 8pm if you have time...
<Blackt> I'll be ragging on the "on" thing for hours now...LOL
<skezz> The sole premis of this room is to talk on politics, yet your arguement is me talking of politics
<][Hook][> heh
<Blackt> ;)
<skezz> It's irony at it's greatest I suppose, being bitched at for talking politics in #politics
<skezz> but then, life tends to be ironic from time to time [=
<][Hook][> skezz: point taken.  I was just hoping you weren't taking it all too seriously.
<Blackt> skezz, did someone pay you to come in here and voice a few choice opinions?.. or are you in leaque with a group of people that do that? What is it you do?.. and why? I'm just curious.
<MPouxesas> a reminder: politics (def): compound word from 'poli' in Greek meaning MANY, and 'tics' small tiny blood sucking creatures
<][Hook][> MP =]
<skezz> Blackt:  Noone pays me to be here, what kind of arguement is that even close to?
<MPouxesas> hello kids
<][Hook][> that correctly describes many politicians
<MPouxesas> hook :)
<MPouxesas> MeatHook: :)
<MPouxesas> ops :) damn nick completion :)
<skezz> Blackt:  You arn't making much sense, but I wouldn't expect you to
<Blackt> skezz, it must have flown over your head.. someone said you would be "on" for awhile as if they knew you're scheduled time in this channel.
<skezz> So unless I am paid to be "into" politics ie: running for an elected office, I cannot talk about it?
<skezz> in a political room?
<skezz> is that what you're saying Blackt?
<Blackt> nope
<skezz> Blackt:  Are you awear this room is not China practices?
<skezz> has not* rather
<Blackt> I don't know what China practices are.. sorry.
<][Hook][> skezz: I apologize if I was preaching.  I just saw that what you said was being eclipsed by how you said it.  Brash and confrontational is a hard strategy.
<skezz> ][Hook][:  tis ok, np at all
<Mootar> what is our threat level, orange or red?
<MPouxesas> skezz: you probably don't realize (or forget) that this is a channel frequented (and controlled) by predominantly US/republican/pro war/pro anything YOU don't like (:)
<skezz> Blackt:  I am refering to your Communistic view on how you think I should talk
<MPouxesas> users :)
<skezz> MPouxesas:  If this room is (a majority) right slant, then I fit in rather nicely
<MPouxesas> skezz: then how and you're arguing? :)
<skezz> MPouxesas:  But, I see many voice many opinions, all the time
<skezz> MPouxesas:  And it is delt with very fairly from what I see here as a non-op, non-affiliated user
<MPouxesas> aah, and you are from my favorite state too :)
<skezz> to this IRC channel
<Blackt> I have no view on how you should talk.. I asked if you were paid to come in here or in league with a group that takes turns coming in here with an agenda and known beforehand choice of opinions. A simple yes or no will do.
<skezz> No, I am not from GA
<MPouxesas> va
<MPouxesas> i see richmond VA

<Blackt> I repeat: I have no view on how you should talk.. I asked if you were paid to come in here or in league with a group that takes turns coming in here with an agenda and known beforehand choice of opinions. A simple yes or no will do.
<skezz> Blackt:  Of course im not paid to talk here,

<Duffsterr> Kaliuna, cloudy, overcast skies
<Kaliuna> Dr Lee -- oh but they do look for bad spelling ofnames

<][Hook][> which means all messages transmitted
<Blackt> they mark and watch some channels
<skezz> Well, I guess no more EFNet cybersex
<Kaliuna> Duff -- ahh tonight -- was what was on news
<skezz> the FBi could be watching (rotf)
<Duffsterr> they screen #dss channels
<Kaliuna> and it feels "heavy" outside -- air is very -- stormy
<][Hook][> that's why most warez channels use encryption scripts in channel
<Duffsterr> Kaliuna, ewwwwwwwww, snow

<DrLee> MPouxesas, hehe.
<skezz> Kaliuna:  I don't run a channel, and various bots
<Kaliuna> skezz - true -- 
<skezz> I guess it's just my pref's I suppose
<noble-> well.. Bots are so you don't have to be here though....
<MPouxesas> noble-: exactly
<DrLee> I'm sure I still have some eggs around dalnet, havent check them for like a year.
<Kaliuna> DrLee -- I thought dalnet was kapppooot
<skezz> Nothing wrong with IRC (well, nothing obvious), I just don't believe in running IRC idle
<skezz> its a waste (to me)
<skezz> mabey not to you I suppose, and thats ok 
<][Hook][> dalnet is kaput
<DrLee> What's with Susan and that quit,. Hey Feds I have nothing to do with that.
<Kaliuna> there's a basket in the corner for waste
<MPouxesas> skezz: not really, if you pay cable, what's an irc client costing you? nothing really
<noble-> I think IRC is an excellant place for conversation.. and especially for communication between groups or whatever
<DrLee> Kaliuna, yeah that network is gone down the drain.
<skezz> MPouxesas:  costing you a lot if you keep it poorly maintained
<noble-> But no, I don't live here either.. 
<Kaliuna> DrLee -- thought so...
<skezz> MPouxesas:  and have something someone wants, 
<skezz> MPouxesas:  or bandwidth someone wants to sue
<skezz> use* even
<MPouxesas> noble-: i agree, but from my..humble experience, the majority of ppl i "met" (and/or in person) in irc, ...well, how to put it...there was something wrong with them :)
<Blackt> lol
<noble-> lol
<MPouxesas> skezz: ehe, your mind in..sueing :)
<Susan`> heh MPouxesas
<noble-> I don't usually meet people from IRC
<skezz> MPouxesas:  idlie's with poorly maintained boxen are highley seeked 
<skezz> (these days)
<Kaliuna> ohoh -- hope there are no Canadians here -- you stay home if you are -- you guys got that nasty bug
<noble-> I look at IRC as a newage walkie talkie.. I use it most with real life friends, in that fashion
<skezz> MPouxesas:  not saying that yours is
<noble-> or in topical conversation areas like this place
<MPouxesas> noble-: i met probably about...15 ppl from irc (when i was single a few girls too :) but for some peculiar reason...there was something wrong with them, i can't put my finger on what exactly that is, but definitely something :)
<Kaliuna> Top officials in Toronto's medical staff believe up to 3,000 people may have been exposed -- directly or indirectly -- to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Toronto Sun sources.
<DrLee> Susan`, what's with your quit message, wanna get me in trouble? hehehe
<MPouxesas> skezz: yes you are right on that one :(
<skezz> MPouxesas:  Lets say for instance, you keep idle on EF, lets say, you keep a poorly maintained box, I watch you a few times off and on, and could break into your box with ease
<Kaliuna> An "unprecedented" quarantine of thousands of Torontonians has been ordered to stop the deadly spread of SARS, which has also been declared a provincial emergency.
<skezz> MPouxesas:  You are officially a gold mind for a zombie
<MPouxesas> skezz: yeap, you can do that
<skezz> MPouxesas:  thats all im saying, if you plan to keep processes that you know are not secure
<skezz> you must take time to maintain them
<MPouxesas> although i don't run anything from a box (at home), but from another box just an ircd and some websites
<skezz> an idle process on IRC is not a secure process, not by Win32 standards, and surely not by Unix or Linux standards
<skezz> its anything but
<MPouxesas> skezz: yes you are right, irc is one of the least secure processes
<Kaliuna> United Way has cancelled Susan Serandon from their fund raiser
<skezz> Kaliuna:  good =D
<Blackt> figures
<noble-> pffft
<noble-> ohh breaking news
<Blackt> Americans are a hostile nasty bunch.
<Blackt> ;)
<noble-> that's right
<noble-> recognize!
<skezz> MPouxesas:  And cable bandwidth (in general) is a nice little piece of pie, if I wanted a DoS zombie
<noble-> true
<skezz> MPouxesas:  Thats why I don't beleive in or like idle IRC processes
<Kaliuna> PARK FOREST, Ill. -- A freelance photographer shooting a fire in south suburban Park Forest captured a bright flash of light that "turned midnight to noon" for several seconds, and police said it appeared it was the breaking up of a meteorite.
<MPouxesas> skezz: yeap...but not really if you want to cause a massive damage (lets say something like the one dalnet suffered)
<Kaliuna> see there are other things going on in this USA
<skezz> MPouxesas:  if you wanted to cause any damage, your PC is not going to be the lone zombie used
<skezz> MPouxesas:  You know that
<skezz> MPouxesas:  Zombies are used in masses
<Blackt> Kaliuna, FYI it is policy, if the earth is doomed to destruction by oncoming meteors, that nobody will be told...LOL..
<Kaliuna> on that meteorite note -- will go back to working on something or other...
<Kaliuna> you all behave ....

<Kaliuna> Black - some were pretty good sized... see Drudge -- nice report link there.
<Kaliuna> now - back to work!
<Duffsterr> Kaliuna, that's true, Area 51 has many living aliens...  :)
<MPouxesas> skezz: i know i know, but i am saying that the serious kind of damage (for example the one in dalnet) is not gonna happen with a few cable modems :)
<skezz> MPouxesas:  a few cable modems?  no .. but when you are looking to take down system
<skezz> MPouxesas:  You take what tou can get, if you can't get access to a round of T1s
<skezz> MPouxesas:  You take the next best offer
<skezz> and so on

<Duffsterr> skezz, minority report?
<MPouxesas> ahahahahahha
<MPouxesas> yes yes
<Amenra> making a DNS bot isn't that hard
<skezz> MPouxesas:  FBI IT dept employee's are well trained
<Amenra> keeping it alive can be though
<Amenra> trained in standard procedure
<Amenra> not the arts of hacking
<skezz> Amenra:  There are some very smart IT people heading up in the FBI
<Amenra> which is why the common hacker can always outdo any gov agency
<skezz> I wouldn't be so sure
<Amenra> smart?...to what extent?
<DrLee> They are so well trained they use windoz and call a sniffer 'Carnivore'
<Amenra> MIT grads?
<skezz> Amenra:  That is only true, b.c there is always change in that enviroment of hacking
<skezz> everyday
