# This is a special-purpose binary translation patch which starts with
# GAME.EXE, and creates a trimmed down binary which we run internally
# to perform rendering on the sub screen.
#
# We want to start with GAME.EXE since it's the only binary that knows
# about the fourth robot, but we trim out most of the code via
# patching.  Everything that modifies the world state can be removed,
# since we're just rendering the state copied from another binary.

# number is RO_ROOM_RENDERER (0) This gives us an easy way to disable
# playfield rendering, to save CPU cycles. The screen will not be
# cleared at all with playfield rendering disabled, so it's up to our
# C code to clear the parts that are being used.
#
# Note that we can't use RO_ROOM_NONE, since it's special. We just need
# a normal room that has no objects on it.
