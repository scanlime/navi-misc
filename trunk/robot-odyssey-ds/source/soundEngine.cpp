 * Sound engine for Robot Odyssey DS. This is a special-purpose PC
 * speaker emulator which runs mainly on the ARM7. It is designed to
 * handle the PC speaker mode Robot Odyssey uses, in which the speaker
 * output is used as a 1-bit DAC.
 *
 * The PC speaker emulation is performed in software, and we stream
 * the results to the DS's sound hardware via a single looping sound
 * channel. We double-buffer this sound channel in two halves. While
 * the first half is playing, we're filling the second half, and vice
 * versa.
