Gameplay
--------

- Main Menu
- Load/save menus
- Touchscreen support for changing cursor modes
- Touchscreen soldering mode

Polish
------

- Double-buffer the sub screen. There isn't enough memory
  to have two buffers for each screen, but we don't need
  one- we can share a backbuffer, for 3 buffers total.

Robustness
----------

- Power down audio hardware on sleep

Efficiency
----------

- Fixed frame rate: Count VBIs, don't just wait for them.
- Replace memcpy and struct copies with DMA (async, if possible)
- Compress GBFS files
- Move data segment images into GBFS, compress them too
- Examine generated ARM code, look for optimizations
