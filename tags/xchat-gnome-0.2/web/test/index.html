xchat-gnome is a new frontend to the popular X-Chat IRC client which is designed
with the user interface foremost in mind. Historically, the OSS desktop has been
steadily improving in usability, accessibility, and general slickness, yet the
world of IRC clients has not kept up. With IRC being one of the fundamental methods
of communication within the open source community, it is bizzare that this area
has been neglected.
</p>

<p>
GNOME's philosophy in terms of user interfaces has been progressing towards presenting
the user with few options, yet sane defaults. While many of the normal X-Chat options
will be preserved inside GConf, only the most common settings will be included in
the main user interface. The GTK+ frontend provides excessive customizability, with
options scattered throughout the interface. This leads to an inconsistent user experience,
confusion, and general clutter.

<p>
One thing to note is that this project is still extremely young. As such, at the moment
is is not extremely trivial to build, run or debug. If anyone is interested in helping
