This is just a preliminary roadmap, subject to whatever people want to work on.

0.3:
	Color palette/schemes
	Network/server configuration

0.4:
	Redo all the existing DCC stuff
	Finish implementing everything else in the prefs dialog
		(hilighting, etc)

0.5:
	Split things such that multiple conversation windows are possible
