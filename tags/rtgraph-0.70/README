rtgraph
version 0.70
-------------

rtgraph is a collection of real-time graphing widgets for Gtk 2, written in Python.
It includes widgets for scrolling line graphs, polar graphs, cartesian 3D graphs,
and UI elements for manipulating these graphs.

Tweak is a companion module included with rtgraph, for easily building Gtk user
interfaces for manipulating data in real-time. Tweak makes it very easy to bind
a set of python attributes in existing objects to a simple Gtk UI. It is used by
some or rtgtaph's UI components, but is also quite usable on its own.
