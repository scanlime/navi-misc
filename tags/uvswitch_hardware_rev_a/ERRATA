Errata for the revision A uvswitch PCB and schematic
----------------------------------------------------

1. The bypass switch is incorrectly wired to the WHITE_OUT (audio)
   signal rather than YELLOW_OUT. (video)
   Workaround:
     - Locate the via connected to pin 13 of U2
     - Cut the trace coming out of this via on the bottom side of the PCB
     - Run a wire from this via to the center of the J_YO connector
