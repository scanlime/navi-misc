* Several options in the 'Discussion' menu don't make sense for servers
* Connect dialog should have a "connect in new ???" option. Maybe just do
  that as the default and let users close other connections, since replacing
  the current server is weird.
* Double-clicking a server in the networks page should open it's edit dialog
