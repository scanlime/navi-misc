- The context menu does not gracefully handle channels with the same name
  on different servers.
- Add libnotify support
- Tooltips

Preferences:
  - Allow user to set a notify on hilight only option. So that the notification icon
    only changes when the nick is said. Context menu still shows regular messages and
    notifications.
  - configure types of events that cause tooltips
