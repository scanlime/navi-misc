Errata for the revision A uvswitch PCB and schematic
----------------------------------------------------

1. The bypass switch is incorrectly wired to the WHITE_OUT (audio)
   signal rather than YELLOW_OUT. (video)
   Workaround:
     - Locate the via connected to pin 13 of U2
     - Cut the trace coming out of this via on the bottom side of the PCB
     - Run a wire from this via to the center of the J_YO connector

2. The I2C bus pull-up resistors are absent. They were originally not in
   the design because the video switches are write-only devices, but I had
   forgotten about the acknowledge bit in the I2C protocol.
   Workaround:
     - Connect two 4.7k resistors from the SDA and SCL signals to Vcc.
       In the revision A prototype these were soldered behind U1.
