		<p>Fyre provides a rendering of the Peter de Jong map, with an interactive
		GTK+ frontend and a command line interface for easy and efficient rendering
		of high-resolution, high quality images.</p>
		<p>This program was previously known as 'de Jong Explorer', but has been
		renamed to make way for supporting other chaotic functions.</p>
		<p>All the images you can create with this program are based on the simple
		Peter de Jong map equations:
		<br/>x' = sin(a * y) - cos(b * x)
		<br/>y' = sin(c * x) - cos(d * y)
		</p>
		<p>For most values of a,b,c and d the point (x,y) moves chaotically. The
		resulting image is a map of the probability that the point lies within
		the area represented by each pixel. As you let Fyre render longer it collects
		more samples and this probability map and the image becomes more accurate.</p>
		<p>The resulting probability map is treated as a High Dynamic Range image.
		This software includes some image manipulation features that let you
		apply linear interpolation and gamma correction at the full internal
		precision, producing a much higher quality image than if you tried to
		create the same effects using standard image processing tools.
		Additionally, Gaussian blurs can be applied to the image using a
		stochastic process that produces much more natural-looking images than
		most programs, again without losing any of the image's original precision.</p>
