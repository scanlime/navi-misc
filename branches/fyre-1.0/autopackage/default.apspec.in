[Description]
Fyre is a tool for producing computational artwork based on histograms of
iterated chaotic functions. At the moment, it implements the Peter de Jong map
in a fixed-function pipeline with an interactive GTK+ frontend and a command
line interface for easy and efficient rendering of high-resolution, high
quality images.
