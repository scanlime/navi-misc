- It would be nice to have support for minimizing to the windows
  systray when in console mode. This combined with a way to run
  a rendering server on startup would make it easier to keep windows
  machines permanently in a cluster.

- When a fyre cluster node disconnects, it would be nice if it
  automatically retries. This would make it possible to re-add cluster
  nodes automatically when they restart, which currently isn't possible
  even with cluster autodetection.

- When opening an animation from the command line, it would
  be nice if it replaced the current parameter set with the
  first keyframe
