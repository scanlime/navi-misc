- parameter_holder_load_string() always resets to defaults
  then processes the string of serialized parameters. Normally
  this is fine, but when browsing forward/back in several images
  of non-default size, the size repeatedly changes. This could
  be solved by making parameter_holder_load_string() smarter,
  or by making the histogram view smarter about resizing.

- Cluster autodetection doesn't find multiple fyre
  servers running on different ports but the same host

- Cluster autodetection will find fyre servers on
  localhost. This should probably be disabled if we
  can determine the machine is single-processor.

- When rendering on the command line using a cluster,
  it won't wait for pending histogram merges to arrive
  before terminating. On most cluster renders this isn't
  noticeable, but on very short renders of relatively large
  or oversampled images, the render can terminate while
  partial buffers have been merged, leaving ugly horizontal
  banding on the resulting image.
