- The --help text is too wide for an 80-column terminal

- Cluster autodetection doesn't find multiple fyre
  servers running on different ports but the same host

- Cluster autodetection will find fyre servers on
  localhost. This should probably be disabled if we
  can determine the machine is single-processor.

- When rendering on the command line using a cluster,
  it won't wait for pending histogram merges to arrive
  before terminating. On most cluster renders this isn't
  noticeable, but on very short renders of relatively large
  or oversampled images, the render can terminate while
  partial buffers have been merged, leaving ugly horizontal
  banding on the resulting image.
