- The new quality metric is quite slow, relative to the old
  one at least. It might be further improved, but the first
  thing to do is run it much less often. In GUI mode it should
  be run no more often than the image update, and in batch
  rendering it should be run once per status update. Status
  updates maybe should slow down a bit, especially on the
  command line animation renderer.

- Cluster autodetection doesn't find multiple fyre
  servers running on different ports but the same host

- Cluster autodetection will find fyre servers on
  localhost. This should probably be disabled if we
  can determine the machine is single-processor.

- When rendering on the command line using a cluster,
  it won't wait for pending histogram merges to arrive
  before terminating. On most cluster renders this isn't
  noticeable, but on very short renders of relatively large
  or oversampled images, the render can terminate while
  partial buffers have been merged, leaving ugly horizontal
  banding on the resulting image.
