The Media Infrawidget 6000 project contains hardware and
software for a USB device that includes an lirc-compatible
consumer IR transceiver, two LEDs with high resolution
brightness, and a serial interface for communicating with
a vacuum fluorescent display.

Status:
We have two MI6K prototypes running quite smoothly here.
There was talk of offering them commercially to people that
can't build their own or would rather not, but there wasn't
enough interest. The kernel module still needs porting to
Linux 2.6
