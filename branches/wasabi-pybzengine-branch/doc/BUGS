Hardware:

 - mi6k IR transmitter still not working

 - mi6k receiver doesn't work in lircd properly until mode2 is run

 - uvswitch gets interference between input channels, possibly
   an issue with a DC bias and the clamping diodes

UI:

 - After exiting VideoChannelPage, an extra IR button event
   kills the logo immediately

 - Icons being added or removed dynamically animate incorrectly

 - Video detected on an unbound input channel crashes the UI

 - Video inputs becoming inactive during VideoChannelPage crashes the UI

 - The UI will use all available CPU even if the menu isn't being animated.
   The ThreeDView and/or Viewport need to become smarter about animation and
   only run the ContinuousTimer for redrawing frames when there's an active
   animation.
